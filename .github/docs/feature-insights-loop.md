# Insights Loop

The insights loop is the core experience flow of the product. It is the process of generating insights and guidance from interviews and conversations.

Start:

- Upload recordings or transcripts.

- Ask user (while uploading?)
 	- What kind of content? interviews with customers, live conversations, focus groups, etc.
 	- What is the goal? decide on pricing, new features, changes in service terms, etc.

- Respond: OK, I will(insert specifics, search for pain, refine persona, explore motivations, etc)

Template: I want to ___ so I can ____.
While trying to do **GOAL/Desired_outcome**, people struggle with **pain** because **WHY: Details/context**.

**Dashboard Key Value**: Quickly tell users:

- top pain points or insights (impact vs frequency) & themes
- suggested next steps, questions
- product/service opportunities.
- dynamic persona descriptions
