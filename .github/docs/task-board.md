# Project Task Board

> **Source of Truth** ‚Äì last updated: 2025-07-06 23:05-06:00

## ‚úÖ Done

- Draft & save comprehensive product plan (`docs/product-plan.md`).
- Resolve initial open questions (ASR model, batching, privacy scope, persona clustering, interview scale).
- Fix README link to product plan.
- [x] **Process Data** ‚Äì upload recording, batch transcribe via AssemblyAI, store transcript in db
- [x] **Supabase Project & CI** ‚Äì initialise local Supabase, add Vitest + Playwright pipelines.
- [x] **Component PoC** ‚Äì build Storybook for `<InsightCard>` and `<ThemeMatrix>`.

## üé® UX Track

- [x] Define end-to-end user flow (`user-flow.md`)
- [x] Create low-fi wireframes (`wireframes.md`)
- [x] Draft UI style & component palette (`ui-style.md`)
- [x] Implement Jett's inline edit component (`inline-edit.tsx`) resolve Markdown dependency issue.
- [x] **Insight Card** ‚Äì inline editable insight fields.
- [ ] add 'inline edit' in other records like interviews etc.
- [ ] CRUD functions for people, projects, personas, tags, opportunities
- [ ] How to make UX Better to get maximum WOW insights? (revise `user-flow.md`)

## üîú Up Next (Sprint 1 ‚Äì Get Valuable Insights)

- [x] **Enable User-Org** - needed for basic record ownership
- [x] **Embeddings Pipeline** ‚Äì generate embeddings for insights and themes.
- [x] **Fix remaining routes** - interview list and detail pages done. See `_NavLayout.insights/index.tsx` and `_NavLayout.interviews/$interviewId/route.tsx`. Use as templates for display indexes, detaili pages for insights, projects, personas, people, opportunities.
- [ ] **Insight Clustering Visualization** - Cluster insights by category and pain points to visualise themes. [clustering-howto.md](clustering-howto.md)
- [ ] Intro Testing framework and coverage [howto test](testing-howto.md)

## üåì Backlog / Later

- [x] User login, org membership, multi-tenant Auth and RLS
- [ ] fix login-redirect, and sign-in flow
- [ ] Add Research Projects route, list, cards, CRUD. @web <https://v0.dev/chat/research-project-components-qHfJ0d4vxEP>
- [ ] **Auto-Insights** - Distill insights and help make executive decisions, answering key questions like "What are the top opportunities?" and "What are the top pain points?", "What changes would benefit different personas the most?" and "What are the best revenue-generating opportunities?" and "Which personas are likely to pay for what?" and "(Given key competitive pressures) what are the most profitable opportunities?"
- [ ] Extraction Guidance: User specified constraints for auto-insights. eg. sales, marketing, product, etc. Auto-merge tags, provide as prompts to LLM in BAML extraction process.
- [ ] Persona clustering tuning: help refine personas.
- [ ] Show Realtime status on transcriptions and insights (once pipeline is in place)
- [ ] Real-time transcription upgrade path.
- [ ] **Prompt/Eval Harness** ‚Äì draft LLM prompt templates, add quality-eval scripts.
- Encryption & PII-handling module.

- [ ] Insights schema tweaks:

Opinionated tweak suggestions (optional):

Type alignment: Make confidence smallint (1‚Äì3) or an enum if you want strictness; same for emotional_response.

**Rename motivation ‚Üí underlying_motivation for clarity with your BAML schema.

**Add CHECK (journey_stage in (...)) if your stages are fixed.

- [ ] Enable user to re-generate insights with custom user instructions (optional) and add into a new queue called: `generate_insights_queue`. Default redoes the given interviewid from 'transcript' column. This would call BAML with the given instructions and generate new insights. we should expose this as an action API and callable from the UI or a db trigger (would want as edge function?)

- [ ] ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù tagging (medium effort)
Problem: users may create semantically-duplicate tags (safety, transport_safety, night_travel).

Plan:

Fetch existing tags for the account (SELECT tag FROM tags WHERE account_id = ‚Ä¶).
Call BAML with:
system: You are TagNormalizer.  Given `candidate_tags` and `existing_tags`, return
        a mapping: {candidate_tag: canonical_tag}.
        If there is no suitable existing tag, return NEW.
This is a lightweight, single-shot mapping ‚Äì no schema change.
Apply mapping
If canonical_tag === 'NEW' ‚Üí insert new tag
else ‚Üí reuse existing canonical_tag.
Benefits

Reuses semantically-close tags automatically
Keeps tag table clean without manual admin
