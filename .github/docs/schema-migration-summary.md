# Database Schema Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed migration from array-based tag relationships to normalized junction tables, improving data integrity, query performance, and enabling advanced analytics.

## Migration Completed

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** ✅ Complete and deployed to production
**Database Changes:** Applied to both local and remote Supabase instances

## Schema Changes

### Junction Tables Created

1. **`insight_tags`** - Many-to-many between insights and tags
   - Replaces `insights.related_tags` array field
   - Structure: `insight_id`, `tag`, `account_id`
   - Foreign key: `tag` references `tags(tag)`

2. **`interview_tags`** - Direct tagging of interviews
   - New functionality for better organization
   - Structure: `interview_id`, `tag`, `account_id`
   - Foreign key: `tag` references `tags(tag)`

3. **`opportunity_insights`** - Links opportunities to insights
   - Replaces `opportunities.related_insight_ids` array field
   - Structure: `opportunity_id`, `insight_id`, `weight`
   - Supports weighted relationships

4. **`project_people`** - Tracks people across projects
   - Structure: `project_id`, `person_id`, `role`, `interview_count`, `first_seen_at`, `last_seen_at`
   - Automatic statistics tracking via triggers

5. **`persona_insights`** - Links insights to personas
   - Structure: `persona_id`, `insight_id`, `relevance_score`
   - Supports relevance scoring for analytics

### Schema Ordering Fixed

- Renamed `opportunities.sql` → `32_opportunities.sql` for proper dependency order
- Junction tables now load after all referenced tables exist
- Migration `20250725192033_schema_updates.sql` captures final schema state

## Data Migration

### Migration Utilities

- **Array Migration API:** `/api/migrate-arrays` - Converts array fields to junction tables
- **Migration UI:** `/migrate` - User-friendly interface for migration status and execution
- **Backfill API:** `/api/backfill-people` - Repairs missing person records

### Migration Process

1. **Tags Migration:** `insights.related_tags[]` → `insight_tags` junction table
2. **Opportunity Insights:** `opportunities.related_insight_ids[]` → `opportunity_insights` junction table
3. **Person Creation:** Ensures every interview has a corresponding person record
4. **Junction Linking:** Establishes all many-to-many relationships

## Code Updates

### Helper Functions

Comprehensive helper library created in `app/lib/database/`:

- **`junction-helpers.ts`** - Core junction table management classes
- **`junction-server.ts`** - Server-side utilities with authentication
- **`useJunctionTables.ts`** - React hooks for client-side operations
- **`junction-examples.ts`** - Documentation and usage examples

### Route Updates

All routes updated to use junction table queries:

- **Insights routes:** Use `insight_tags` instead of `related_tags` array
- **Interview routes:** Support new `interview_tags` functionality
- **Opportunity routes:** Use `opportunity_insights` instead of array field

### Query Patterns

**Before (Array-based):**

```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('insights')
  .select('*, related_tags')
  .eq('account_id', accountId)
```

**After (Junction-based):**

```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('insights')
  .select(`
    *,
    insight_tags(tag)
  `)
  .eq('account_id', accountId)
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Strategy

- **Pure Unit Tests:** 96 tests for business logic without mocks
- **Integration Tests:** Real database validation for schema and queries
- **Coverage Reports:** HTML reports available at `coverage/index.html`

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:cov
```

### Test Status

- **185 passing tests** - All core business logic validated
- **51 failing tests** - Authentication and environment issues (non-blocking)
- **~60% coverage** - Focus on critical business flows

## Performance Improvements

### Indexes Added

- `idx_insight_tags_insight_id`, `idx_insight_tags_tag`, `idx_insight_tags_account_id`
- `idx_interview_tags_interview_id`, `idx_interview_tags_tag`, `idx_interview_tags_account_id`
- `idx_opportunity_insights_opportunity_id`, `idx_opportunity_insights_insight_id`
- `idx_project_people_project_id`, `idx_project_people_person_id`
- `idx_persona_insights_persona_id`, `idx_persona_insights_insight_id`

### Query Benefits

- **Better JOIN performance** - Proper foreign key relationships
- **Flexible filtering** - Query by tags, insights, or combinations
- **Analytics support** - Aggregate queries across relationships
- **Data integrity** - Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All junction tables have comprehensive RLS policies:

- **Account isolation** - Users can only access their account's data
- **CRUD permissions** - Proper insert/update/delete restrictions
- **Consistent patterns** - Same security model across all tables

### Authentication

- **Server-side validation** - All operations use authenticated Supabase client
- **Account scoping** - Automatic account ID extraction from JWT claims
- **Permission checks** - Validate user access before operations

## Next Steps

### Completed ✅

- [x] Schema migration to junction tables
- [x] Data migration from arrays to normalized structure
- [x] Helper functions and utilities
- [x] Route updates for new schema
- [x] Integration tests with real database
- [x] Documentation and examples

### Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Remove legacy array-based code after verification
- [ ] Expand test coverage for uncovered edge cases
- [ ] Monitor performance in production
- [ ] Add advanced analytics features using junction tables

## Rollback Plan

If needed, rollback is possible via:

1. **Database rollback:** Revert to migration before `20250725025214_junction_tables.sql`
2. **Code rollback:** Git revert to commit before junction table implementation
3. **Data preservation:** Junction table data can be converted back to arrays if needed

## Support

- Review helper function examples in `app/lib/database/junction-examples.ts`
- Check integration tests for usage patterns
- Consult testing documentation in `.github/docs/testing-howto.md`

## Additional DB Changes (7/28/2025)

### Where FKs vs. junctions are best

**One‑to‑many → Foreign key**
insights.account_id → accounts.accounts.id (already).

insights.interview_id → interviews.id (already).

interviews.project_id → projects.id (already).

people.account_id → accounts.accounts.id — present but nullable; make NOT NULL.

**Many‑to‑many → Junction table**
Already correct and should stay:

People ↔ Interviews → interview_people (PK (interview_id, person_id)).

People ↔ Personas → people_personas. But revise PK, see below.

Opportunities ↔ Insights → opportunity_insights (unique (opportunity_id, insight_id)).

Personas ↔ Insights → persona_insights (unique (persona_id, insight_id)).

Interviews ↔ Tags → interview_tags (unique triple).

Insights ↔ Tags → insight_tags (unique triple).

### Concrete fixes & migrations

1) CONSIDER: Let a person hold the same persona multiple times (time series)
Problem: PK on people_personas is (person_id, persona_id); you also capture interview_id and assigned_at. You can’t store another assignment of the same persona for the same person.

Change (recommended):

Add surrogate id uuid default gen_random_uuid() as PK.

Add optional uniqueness you actually want, e.g. allow duplicates over time but prevent duplicates within the same interview.

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.people_personas
  ADD COLUMN id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY;

-- Drop old PK
ALTER TABLE public.people_personas
  DROP CONSTRAINT people_personas_pkey;

-- Prevent duplicate assignments within the same interview
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX people_personas_unique_per_interview
  ON public.people_personas(person_id, persona_id, interview_id)
  WHERE interview_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Optionally, if you also want to prevent exact duplicates per day:

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX people_personas_unique_daily
  ON public.people_personas(person_id, persona_id, date_trunc('day', assigned_at));
```

2) CONSIDER: Make people.account_id NOT NULL

**people is mainly for interview subjects who dont have an account on our system**

You use it everywhere for tenancy; keeping it nullable invites orphaned data and RLS surprises.

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX people_personas_unique_daily
  ON public.people_personas(person_id, persona_id, date_trunc('day', assigned_at));
 ```

2) Make people.account_id NOT NULL
You use it everywhere for tenancy; keeping it nullable invites orphaned data and RLS surprises.

```sql
-- Backfill if any nulls exist; set to a safe account or delete
-- UPDATE public.people SET account_id = '<some-account-uuid>' WHERE account_id IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE public.people
  ALTER COLUMN account_id SET NOT NULL;
```

#### 3) TODO: Remove duplicated relationship on opportunities

You have both:

opportunities.related_insight_ids uuid[] and

opportunity_insights junction (the source of truth).

Keep the junction; drop the array.

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.opportunities
  DROP COLUMN related_insight_ids;
```

If you like a cached array for quick reads, make it derived (materialized view or trigger-maintained), not the writable truth.

#### 4) DONE: Align trigger_set_user_tracking with columns

You attach set_insights_user_tracking but insights lacks created_by/updated_by. Either add the columns or remove the trigger from that table.

Option A – add columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.insights
  ADD COLUMN created_by uuid,
  ADD COLUMN updated_by uuid;

ALTER TABLE public.insights
  ADD CONSTRAINT insights_created_by_fkey FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  ADD CONSTRAINT insights_updated_by_fkey FOREIGN KEY (updated_by) REFERENCES auth.users(id);
```

Option B – drop the tracking trigger on insights:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_insights_user_tracking ON public.insights;
(Repeat this audit for any other table with that trigger but without the columns.)

#### 5) CONSIDER: carrying account_id on junctions

Today you enforce tenancy via EXISTS to parent tables in RLS policies (works, but every read does an extra join). Example for people_personas uses an EXISTS against people.

Trade‑off:

Add account_id to junctions + FK to accounts.accounts gives simpler policies and faster filters/indexes.

Slight redundancy, but you can enforce correctness with a constraint or trigger that checks account consistency across referenced parents.

If you adopt it, add composite indexes like (account_id, person_id) / (account_id, persona_id) for common filters.

#### 6) DONE: RLS for tags

I see RLS enabled broadly, but not an explicit ALTER TABLE public.tags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY in the visible block, though there are GRANTs and an index. Ensure RLS is enabled and add policies mirroring insight_tags/interview_tags.

Example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.tags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Account members can select"
  ON public.tags
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (account_id IN (SELECT accounts.get_accounts_with_role()));

CREATE POLICY "Account members can insert"
  ON public.tags
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (account_id IN (SELECT accounts.get_accounts_with_role()));

CREATE POLICY "Account members can update"
  ON public.tags
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (account_id IN (SELECT accounts.get_accounts_with_role()));

CREATE POLICY "Account owners can delete"
  ON public.tags
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (account_id IN (SELECT accounts.get_accounts_with_role('owner')));
```

#### 7) TODO: Indexing upgrades

You already have strong coverage (account_id, foreign keys, HNSW for vectors). Add:

GIN on arrays used for search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_insights_opportunity_ideas_gin ON public.insights USING gin (opportunity_ideas);
CREATE INDEX idx_insights_related_tags_gin   ON public.insights USING gin (related_tags);
```

Trigram search for fuzzy matching on names / pain / JTBD if you’ll support it:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_people_name_trgm   ON public.people   USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_insights_name_trgm ON public.insights USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_insights_pain_trgm ON public.insights USING gin (pain gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_insights_jtbd_trgm ON public.insights USING gin (jtbd gin_trgm_ops);
```

Status/date combos for dashboards:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_interviews_status_date
  ON public.interviews (status, interview_date);
```

#### 8) TODO: CRITICAL De-dupe persona modeling on people

people has a persona text column plus the normalized people_personas table. Decide on your canonical source. If you want a “primary persona” cache on people, keep it but document that it’s derived from the latest/highest-confidence people_personas. Or drop the column to remove ambiguity.

#### 9) CONSIDER: Metrics views

You built a nice persona_distribution view from interviews’ segment/participant_pseudonym. Consider a second view that aggregates from people_personas (confidence‑weighted, latest‑only, etc.) to complement it.

Sanity checklist for your app’s flows
Multiple interviews per person: Supported via interview_people. To get latest, order by interviews.updated_at or interview_date.

Evolving personas over time: Enable by changing people_personas PK as above and sort by assigned_at/confidence_score.

Opportunity weighting: You already have opportunity_insights.weight. Lean on that and drop the array column.

Embeddings & queues: HNSW index is in place; embedding/enqueue triggers look good.
