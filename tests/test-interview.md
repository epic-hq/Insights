## Interview Transcript

**Alex:** Hi Sarah, thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. Can you tell me about your current role and how you use project management tools?

**Sarah:** Of course! I'm a Product Manager at TechCorp, and I manage a team of 8 developers working on our main SaaS platform. We're constantly juggling multiple features, bug fixes, and customer requests. Right now, we're using a combination of Jira, Slack, and Excel spreadsheets, but it's becoming really fragmented.

**Alex:** What are the main pain points you're experiencing with your current setup?

**Sarah:** The biggest issue is context switching. I spend probably 30% of my day just moving between different tools to get a complete picture of what's happening. For example, if a customer reports a bug, I have to check Slack for the initial report, then Jira to see if there's a ticket, then our Excel sheet to understand the priority and impact on our roadmap. It's exhausting.

**Alex:** That sounds frustrating. How does this affect your team's productivity?

**Sarah:** It's a huge bottleneck. My developers are always waiting for me to provide context or make decisions because I'm spending so much time gathering information instead of actually analyzing it. We've missed several sprint commitments because of delays in prioritization. Last month, we had to push back a major feature release by two weeks just because we couldn't align on what was most important.

**Alex:** What would an ideal solution look like for you?

**Sarah:** I dream of having everything in one place. I want to see customer feedback, development progress, and business impact all in a single dashboard. When a customer reports an issue, I should be able to immediately see how many other customers are affected, what the revenue impact might be, and where it fits in our current sprint. I also need better visibility into my team's capacity and workload.

**Alex:** How do you currently handle customer feedback and feature requests?

**Sarah:** It's all over the place, honestly. We get feedback through support tickets, sales calls, user interviews like this one, and direct emails. I try to maintain a master list in Excel, but it's always out of date. I know we're missing valuable insights because they're buried in different systems. Sometimes I discover that three different customers asked for the same feature, but I only realized it weeks later.

**Alex:** What's your biggest fear about adopting a new tool?

**Sarah:** Change management, definitely. My team is already overwhelmed, and I can't afford to slow them down while they learn something new. I need a solution that integrates with our existing workflow and provides immediate value. If it takes more than a week to see benefits, it's probably not going to work for us.

**Alex:** How do you measure success in your current role?

**Sarah:** Three main metrics: on-time delivery of features, customer satisfaction scores, and revenue impact of the features we ship. Right now, I'm struggling with all three because of the inefficiencies I mentioned. I spend more time on process than on strategic thinking.

**Alex:** Is there anything else you'd like to share about your challenges or needs?

**Sarah:** I think the key thing is that I need to be more proactive rather than reactive. Right now, I'm always putting out fires instead of preventing them. I want to identify trends in customer feedback before they become major issues, and I want to make data-driven decisions about our roadmap instead of going with gut feelings.

## Key Takeaways

- Heavy context switching between multiple tools (Jira, Slack, Excel)
- Lack of unified view of customer feedback and development progress
- Difficulty prioritizing features and managing team capacity
- Need for proactive rather than reactive approach
- Change management concerns with new tool adoption
