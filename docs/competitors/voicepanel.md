## GTM Strategy

| Channel | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Target** | Product teams lacking research resources |
| **Value Prop** | "Research on autopilot" |
| **Demo** | Shows AI conducting live interview |
| **Sales Motion** | Likely product-led with demos |
| **Integrations** | Slack-first delivery, recruitment panels |
| **Positioning** | Full automation, not assistance |

## User Flows

### AI Interview Flow
```
1. Setup
   └─ Define research questions/goals
   └─ Optionally customize AI prompts
   └─ Choose format: voice/video/chat/screenshare
   └─ Embed media (prototypes, websites)

2. Recruit
   └─ Use own participants (free)
   └─ OR use User Interviews/Respondent/Prolific

3. AI Conducts
   └─ AI asks questions
   └─ Listens to responses
   └─ Asks follow-up questions based on answers
   └─ Probes for deeper insights

4. Real-Time Delivery
   └─ Responses stream to Slack
   └─ Team can discuss immediately

5. Analysis
   └─ AI identifies patterns across interviews
   └─ Generates recommendations
   └─ Creates automated report
```

### Key Differentiator: Follow-Up Questions
- AI doesn't just ask preset questions
- Probes based on what user says
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Why do you feel that way?"

## How We Compete

### Direct Comparison

| Feature | VoicePanel | UpSight |
|---------|------------|---------|
| AI interviews | Yes (AI-only) | Yes (Human+AI hybrid) |
| Human-led interviews | **No** | **Yes** |
| Real-time voice chat | Async only | **Yes (LiveKit)** |
| Research lenses | No | **Yes** |
| Repository/evidence | Limited | **Yes** |
| Slack delivery | Yes | Planned |
| Custom AI prompts | Yes | Planned |

### Our Key Advantage: Human + AI Hybrid

**VoicePanel**: Fully automated. AI does everything.
**UpSight**: AI assists, humans lead when needed.

This matters because:
- Some users want human connection
- Sensitive topics need human judgment
- Repetitive tasks can be automated, complex ones need humans
- Stakeholder trust: "We talked to customers" vs. "AI talked to customers"

### Where They Beat Us (Honest Assessment)

| Area | Reality |
|------|---------|
| **AI interviewer maturity** | They've shipped it, we're building |
| **Founder credibility** | Ex-Google, ex-Optimizely, $40M product |
| **Investor network** | Dropbox, Instacart, Airtable founders |
| **Recruitment integrations** | Built-in panels vs. our manual process |
| **Speed to market** | They're live, we're iterating |

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: HIGH

**Why High**:
- Most direct competitor
- Same voice-first AI research space
- YC backing means resources + visibility
- Strong founder pedigree

**Our Differentiation**:
- Human + AI hybrid (they're AI-only)
- Research lenses/frameworks (they're generic)
- Repository layer (they're collection-focused)
- Sales + Product teams (they're product-only)

**Key Risk**: If they add human-assisted modes, our differentiation shrinks.

**Watch For**:
- Human moderation features
- Repository/insights layer
- Sales team features
- Pricing announcements
- Series A and expansion
