# UpSights project definition for Rick's app

## Project Definition (draft)

**Project Title:** Optimal Onboarding for Business Leaders into UpSight

**Goal (What we want to achieve):**
Create an onboarding experience that helps business leaders define clear goals, identify strategic options, and learn how to proceed using customer interviews and data.

---

### Key Decisions (Big choices to make)

1. What is the simplest way for a business leader to clarify their top goal during onboarding?
2. How much structure vs. flexibility should we provide when suggesting strategic options?
3. Should onboarding include live customer input (e.g., sample interview prompts) or stay simulation-based?
4. What metrics prove onboarding success (engagement, clarity, confidence, first actionable plan)?

---

### What to Learn (Things we need to know)

* How business leaders currently set or fail to set clear goals.
* What kinds of strategic options feel most useful vs. overwhelming.
* Whether leaders value “practice interviews” or just structured templates.
* Which onboarding flow increases confidence and readiness to take action.

---

### Questions for Users (Interview Prompts)

* “Walk me through the last time you tried to set a clear growth goal — what helped, what got in the way?”
* “When you’re shown multiple strategic options, what makes you feel confident vs. confused?”
* “Would you want to practice interviewing customers inside onboarding, or just see examples/templates?”
* “How do you know when you’re ready to take action on a plan?”

---

### Other Data Sources

* Analytics on onboarding drop-offs (time to complete steps).
* Surveys on leader confidence before/after onboarding.
* Benchmarks from other SaaS onboarding flows.
* Usage logs showing which options or templates are most reused.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

* **Company size:** Small to mid-sized businesses (10–200 employees) OR early-stage startups.
* **Industry:** Broad (tech, services, consumer products), but all share a **growth mandate**.
* **Stage:** Companies with ambition to grow but lack structured research/product strategy capacity.
* **Pain points:**

  * Leadership overwhelmed with choices, unclear on direction.
  * No in-house research or strategy function.
  * Wasting time/money on scattershot experiments.
