# Docs Index

Use this map to find context quickly. Categories mirror how Claude should load context: start with `00-foundation` then drill down.

- `docs/00-foundation/` — AI routing + standards: CLAUDE/CONTEXT templates, `_information_architecture.md`, `_lens-based-architecture-v2.md`, `_stack-database-plan.md`, `ai-context/`, `agents/`.
- `docs/10-architecture/` — system/data design: `architecture/`, interview processing overviews, clustering, DB scoping/types, refactoring plans, API references.
- `docs/20-features-prds/` — feature specs & design: `features/` (PRDs, research analysis, annotations, etc.), `design/`, `specs/`, CMS implementation, product/sales lens docs.
- `docs/30-howtos/` — runnable guides: deploy/supabase/testing/storybook/trigger.dev, CRUD patterns, development notes, OAuth fix, mastra tools.
- `docs/40-user-guides/` — end-user flows: user guides, CRM workflow, user-flow (with diagrams), conversation analyzer summaries.

- `docs/20-features-prds/features/research-analysis/` — research analysis docs plus diagrams; other diagrams live with their owning feature (no central `diagrams/`).
