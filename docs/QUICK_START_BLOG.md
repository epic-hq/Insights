curl https://upsight-cms.vercel.app/api/posts
```

You should see a JSON response with your posts.

### Step 2: Start Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Test Blog Routes

Visit these URLs:

- <http://localhost:5173/blog> - Blog listing
- <http://localhost:5173/blog/your-post-slug> - Individual post
- <http://localhost:5173/sitemap.xml> - Sitemap (should include blog posts)

## üìù Payload CMS Content Model

Your Payload CMS should have a `posts` collection with these fields:

### Required Fields:
- `title` (text) - Post title
- `slug` (text) - URL-friendly slug
- `content` (richText or textarea) - Post content (HTML)
- `publishedAt` (date) - Publication date
- `status` (select) - "draft" or "published"

### Recommended Fields:
- `excerpt` (textarea) - Short description
- `featured_image` (upload) - Featured image
- `author` (relationship) - Link to authors collection
- `seo.title` (text) - SEO title override
- `seo.description` (textarea) - Meta description
- `seo.keywords` (text) - SEO keywords
- `categories` (relationship) - Post categories
- `tags` (array) - Post tags

---

## üé® Customization

### Change Posts Per Page

Edit `app/routes/blog._index.tsx`:

```typescript
const limit = 12 // Change this number
```

### Customize Blog Card Design

Edit the `BlogCard` component in `app/routes/blog._index.tsx`

### Customize Post Layout

Edit the `BlogPost` component in `app/routes/blog.$slug.tsx`

### Add Custom Styling

The blog uses your existing Tailwind classes. Customize in the component files.

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch posts"

**Solution:**
1. Check `PAYLOAD_CMS_URL` in `.env`
2. Verify CMS is accessible
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test API endpoint directly with curl

### Issue: "Post not found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify post status is "published" in CMS
2. Check slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Look at API response structure

### Issue: Images not loading

**Solution:**
1. Check image URLs in CMS response
2. Verify CORS settings on CMS
3. Images should have full URLs, not relative paths

### Issue: Styling looks broken

**Solution:**
1. Verify Tailwind is working on other pages
2. Check for CSS conflicts
3. Inspect element to see applied classes

## üìä Performance Optimization (Phase 2)

### Add Caching Headers

Already implemented! Blog routes return cache headers:

```typescript
"Cache-Control": "public, max-age=300, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=3600"
```

This means:
- Browser caches for 5 minutes
- CDN caches for 5 minutes
- Stale content served while revalidating for 1 hour

### Cloudflare CDN Setup

1. **Enable Cloudflare** on your domain
2. **Cache Rules** are automatic (respects Cache-Control headers)
3. **Monitor** cache hit rate in Cloudflare dashboard

Expected results:
- 90%+ cache hit rate after warmup
- Sub-second page loads globally
- Reduced CMS API calls
