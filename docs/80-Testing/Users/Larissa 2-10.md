* Customers wish to personalize survey with AI using and or mentioning attributes of the person in the questions or intro. eg. Name, occupation, number of kids, hobbies, etc. Then AI would use this information in a way to setup specific questions, make them feel more comfortable, and use the information for segmetnation and branching logic. eg if has no kids dont ask ages, if has kids ask if they play sports.
	* upload csv with people and attributes

* then use people attributes in ICP matching. it needs to be shown in the UI for "Edit criteria"

  we already have person facets, and the spreadsheet import should give us a way to ingest them onto the person record.
  For existing records, teh user could create a survey, tag a list of users for inclusion, select "Personalize with person attributes and AI" (help reword this into a boss feature name). 

  this could really differentiate us from the crowd.
  Bt we need to keep it from getting too weird, adn ensure the AI uses the information appropriately. Manage this with prompt
  engineering.
