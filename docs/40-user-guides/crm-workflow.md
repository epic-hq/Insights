## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Stakeholder Types

| Code | Role | When to Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| **DM** | Decision Maker | Has final approval authority |
| **I** | Influencer | Provides input, makes recommendations |
| **B** | Blocker | Can prevent or delay purchase |
| **-** | Unknown | Role not yet clear |

### Influence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **High** | Can make or break the deal | C-level, VP, Budget holder |
| **Medium** | Strong voice but not final say | Director, Manager, Champion |
| **Low** | Limited impact on decision | End user, Analyst |

### Deal Stages

| Stage | Description | Typical Activities |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Discovery** | Qualifying the opportunity | Initial conversations, pain discovery |
| **Proposal** | Presenting solution | Demos, POCs, pricing discussions |
| **Negotiation** | Working toward close | Contracts, legal review, approvals |
| **Closed-Won** | Deal signed | Onboarding, implementation |
| **Closed-Lost** | Opportunity lost | Post-mortem, nurture for future |
