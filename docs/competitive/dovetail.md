# Dovetail - Competitive Analysis

**Type**: Direct Competitor (Research Intelligence)
**Last Updated**: January 2026

## Overview

Dovetail is the AI-native customer intelligence platform that transforms customer feedback into real-time intelligence and action. They serve enterprise customers like Atlassian, Shopify, Canva, and Moody's.

## What They Launched (Fall 2025)

- **AI Agents** (closed beta) - automated VoC summaries, issue flagging, Slack alerts
- **AI Dashboards** - qualitative → quantitative visualization
- **AI Docs** - auto-generate PRDs, research reports
- **AI Chat** (GA) - surface insights, answer questions
- **Integrations**: Linear, Salesforce, Gong, Alloy

## Their Architecture (4-Stage Cycle)

```
1. ASSEMBLE → 2. ANALYZE → 3. UNCOVER → 4. ACT
```

1. **Assemble**: Centralize customer signals (sales calls, support, surveys, app reviews)
2. **Analyze**: AI classification, dashboards, segment comparison, sentiment tracking
3. **Uncover**: AI Chat for insights, question answering, document generation
4. **Act**: Linear tickets, Slack alerts, automated reports, prototypes

## Their Strengths

- Deep integrations (Gong, Salesforce, Linear)
- Strong enterprise presence (Atlassian, Shopify, Canva)
- Fast AI feature shipping (2-week cycles via Amazon Bedrock)
- Mature data pipeline (transcription, highlights, redaction)
- 236% ROI, $1.05M productivity gains per study

## Their Gaps (Our Opportunity)

| Gap | Description | Our Advantage |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| Agents in closed beta | Not generally available | We can ship faster |
| No state-aware orchestration | Still feature-based, not journey-aware | We know research stage |
| No proactive guidance | User must ask, system doesn't suggest | We recommend next steps |
| Manual workflow assembly | User drives Assemble → Analyze → Uncover → Act | We guide the journey |

## Spring 2025 Features

- **Magic insights**: Auto-generate structured insight reports from project data
- **Ask Dovetail in Slack**: AI assistant in team conversations
- **Virtual Expert**: AI customer advocate embodying all customer data

## Technical Foundation

- Built on Amazon Bedrock for fast AI feature development
- Can create prototypes within a day, release new AI features in 2 weeks
- Data security, residency, and low latency via AWS

## Watch For

1. When AI Agents come out of closed beta
2. Whether they add proactive recommendations
3. Deeper integration with product tools (Linear, Figma, etc.)
