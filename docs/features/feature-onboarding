# Onboarding

## User Story

Title: Quick & Engaging Onboarding While First Interview Processes

As a new user,
I want a fast and simple onboarding experience that keeps me engaged while my first interview video is processing,
So that I can get started quickly, understand the product’s value, and feel confident my data is being handled securely.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. User can upload their first interview with minimal steps (drag & drop or file picker).
2. After upload, user is shown a series of onboarding cards that auto-advance while processing occurs.
3. Each card provides value (education, tips, product overview, or next steps) and reassures the user about progress.
4. The card series auto-advances at set intervals, but allows manual navigation if desired.
5. If processing completes early, the user is taken directly to their results.
6. If processing fails or is delayed, the user is shown a clear error or status message with next steps.
7. All onboarding steps are mobile-friendly and accessible.
8. User data is handled securely throughout the process.

Edge Cases & Considerations:

- Upload errors (unsupported file, network issues): User receives clear feedback and retry option.
- Very fast processing: Card series may be skipped or shown briefly before redirecting to results.
- Very slow processing: Card series loops or extends with additional tips, and user can opt to be notified by email.
- User navigates away: Processing continues in background, and user is notified when complete.
- Accessibility: All cards are keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.
- Security: Uploaded files are stored securely and deleted if onboarding is abandoned.

## Flow

When a user first signs up, a 'team account' is created and their first project.

After that, they are taken to a onboarding flow where they can upload their first interview by simply dragging and dropping a file, or searching on their computer or phone.

Inputs:

Type of media: interview, conversation, focus group, etc.

Goal (optional) user selectable:

- understand user needs, motivations, preferences, etc. (default)
- evaluate willingness to pay for a feature
- OTHER fill in `custom_instructions`

Processing can take a while, so show a few screens to show progress and educate user on the way.

### Onboarding Card Series (Auto-Advancing Steps)

1. **Processing Interview**
   - Visual progress indicator, reassuring message (“We’re analyzing your interview…”)
2. **What Happens Next**
   - Brief overview of how insights are generated and what to expect.
3. **Tips for Best Results**
   - Suggestions for future uploads (audio quality, interview length, etc.)
4. **Explore Features**
   - Quick highlights of key product features (e.g., insights dashboard, sharing, team collaboration).
5. **Your Privacy Matters**
   - Short note on data security and privacy practices.
6. **Get the Most Out of Insights**
   - Link to resources, guides, or community.
7. **Processing Complete!** (auto-redirects to results when ready)

Each card auto-advances after a few seconds, but users can click to move forward/back or pause if desired.

Future: Allow anonymous upload of interview to get insights, but require sign up to save results and share.
