## Connect Outreach

Hi {{first_name}},

I’d really value your perspective on how we’re doing and where we can improve.
You can choose whatever works best for you:

3–5 minutes – Chat with our virtual assistant → {{bot_link}}

5–10 minutes – Talk with me directly → {{calendar_link}}

We’ll use your feedback to make it easier for teams like yours to turn customer conversations into action.

Thanks so much,
