Takeaway you can literally use in sales:

“They give you highlight reels. We give you decision reels – stitched stories that answer a specific question with balanced voices from across your customer base.”

2. Marketing one-liners

Mix & match depending on placement.

A. For website / feature section

“Turn scattered call notes into one decision-ready highlight reel.”

“Decision Reels: short videos that answer why with your customers’ own words.”

“Stop arguing from opinion. Hit play on the reel and let customers speak for you.”

“From hours of calls to a 3-minute decision reel – tied to one clear question.”

“Highlight reels, upgraded: balanced voices, clear story arc, one decision at the center.”

B. For positioning vs competitors

“Not just highlight reels – decision reels that start from the bet you’re making.”

“Dovetail your clips, Gong your calls… then use UpSight to turn them into one decision story.”

“Other tools clip moments. UpSight assembles a case.”

C. In-app CTAs / tooltips

“Create a decision reel from this theme.”

“Auto-build a reel that answers this question in under 2 minutes.”

“Too much evidence? Let us cut the 3 minutes your execs actually need to see.”

“Generate a reel: we’ll pick the strongest clips, balance personas, and order the story.”
