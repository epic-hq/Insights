> P3 (Sales): "Evidence? Like legal evidence? I'd call these 'customer quotes' or 'proof points'"

> P7 (Founder): "I put this with Insights because evidence supports insights, right?"

#### 2. Tasks Split Between "Planning" and "Action"
- 5 users put Tasks with setup/planning items

## Phase 2: Closed Card Sort Results

### Proposed Categories Tested

| Category | Description Shown |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Plan** | "Set up your research: context, goals, interview guides, priorities" |
| **Sources** | "Your raw materials: conversations, surveys, notes, documents" |
| **Insights** | "What you've learned: themes, findings, analysis" |
| **CRM** | "Who you're talking to: people, companies, opportunities" |

### Agreement Rates by Item

| Item | Plan | Sources | Insights | CRM | Agreement |
|------|------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|
| Company Context | **83%** | 8% | 0% | 8% | ✅ Strong |
| Research Goals | **92%** | 0% | 8% | 0% | ✅ Strong |

### Problem Items (Agreement < 60%)

#### 1. Tasks/Priorities — 58% Plan, 33% CRM
**Why the split:**
- PMs see tasks as research planning
- Sales see tasks as deal/pipeline actions
- Some expected tasks in a standalone "To-Do" area

**Participant Comments:**
> P3 (Sales): "My tasks are follow-ups with prospects. That's CRM stuff."

> P8 (Product): "Planning my research tasks? Definitely Plan."

#### 2. Evidence — 50% Insights, 33% Sources
**Why the split:**
- Evidence *comes from* Sources (conversations)
- Evidence *supports* Insights
- Some users expected Evidence under specific People records

**Participant Comments:**
> P1 (Founder): "Quotes are in my interview notes, so Sources?"

> P5 (PM): "Evidence is proof for my insights. Insights section."

#### 3. Custom Lenses — 42% Insights, 33% CRM, scattered
**Why the confusion:**
- Name is unclear
- Concept is abstract
- Users don't know what it does

**Participant Comments:**
> P6 (Sales): "I still don't know what this is. CRM has filters, so maybe there?"

> P12 (Sales Manager): "Skipping this one. No clue."

#### 4. Segments/Personas — 58% CRM, 42% Insights
**Why the split:**
- Can represent "types of people" (CRM)
- Can represent "research findings" (Insights)
- Depends on whether personas are input or output

### Task Success Rates

| Task | Expected Path | Success | Direct | Avg Time |
|------|---------------|---------|--------|----------|
| "Set up questions for customer interview" | Plan → Interview Prompts | **92%** | 83% | 8s | ✅ |
| "Find quote from customer about pricing" | Insights → Evidence | **50%** | 33% | 22s | ❌ |
| "See list of people you've interviewed" | CRM → People | **83%** | 75% | 10s | ✅ |
| "Review major patterns from research" | Insights → Themes | **92%** | 83% | 9s | ✅ |
| "Find recording of meeting with Acme" | Sources → Conversations | **75%** | 58% | 15s | ⚠️ |
| "Check highest priority tasks" | Plan → Tasks | **67%** | 50% | 18s | ⚠️ |
| "Create survey for prospects" | Sources → Surveys | **58%** | 42% | 20s | ❌ |
| "See deals in pipeline" | CRM → Opportunities | **100%** | 92% | 6s | ✅ |

### Task Failure Analysis

#### Task: "Find quote from customer about pricing" — 50% Success

**Where users went instead:**
- 25% → Sources → Conversations ("quotes are in interviews")
- 17% → CRM → People ("find the person, then their quotes")
- 8% → Used Search

**Insight:** Users think of quotes as attached to the source or person, not as standalone "Evidence."

#### Task: "Create survey for prospects" — 58% Success

**Where users went instead:**
- 25% → Plan ("creating survey is planning")
- 17% → CRM → People ("survey my contacts")

**Insight:** Survey *creation* feels like planning; survey *results* feel like sources.

#### Task: "Check highest priority tasks" — 67% Success

**Where users went instead:**
- 25% → CRM ("my tasks are follow-ups")
- 8% → Expected top-level Tasks area

**Insight:** Sales users strongly associate tasks with pipeline/CRM activities.

## Synthesized Findings

### What's Working

| Element | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Plan** as category name | 75%+ agreement on Context, Goals, Prompts |
| **Sources** as category name | 75%+ agreement on Conversations, Surveys, Notes |
| **CRM** items are clear | 92-100% agreement on People, Orgs, Opportunities |
| **Themes** belongs in Insights | 92% agreement |

### What Needs Work

| Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **"Evidence" is misunderstood** | High | Rename to "Quotes" or show contextually (not nav item) |
| **"Custom Lenses" is confusing** | High | Rename to "Saved Views" or "Analysis Templates" |
| **Tasks split between Plan/CRM** | Medium | Consider: Tasks in Plan = research tasks; separate "Follow-ups" in CRM |
| **Personas location unclear** | Medium | Keep in CRM but add "Persona Insights" in Insights |
| **Survey creation vs results** | Medium | Sources = data; add "Create Survey" action in Plan |
| **Quotes hard to find** | High | Don't bury in Insights → Evidence; surface via search/AI |

---

## Segment-Specific Patterns

### Founders/Entrepreneurs (P1, P4, P7, P10)

**Mental Model:** "I just want to find stuff and know what to do next"

- Less categorical thinking, more search-oriented
- Wanted AI/Search to be prominent, not buried
- Tasks = "what should I do today" (mixed planning + action)
- Lower tolerance for learning new terms ("Lenses"?)

**Quote:**
> P7: "I don't want to click through menus. Can't I just ask it where something is?"

### Product Managers (P2, P5, P8, P11)

**Mental Model:** "Research is a process with inputs and outputs"

- Clearer mental model of research workflow
- Understood Plan → Sources → Insights flow
- Wanted Personas in Insights (it's a research output)
- Tasks = research planning activities

**Quote:**
> P5: "This makes sense. Context and goals first, then collect data, then analyze."

### Sales People (P3, P6, P9, P12)

**Mental Model:** "Everything relates to people and deals"

- Strong CRM orientation
- Tasks = follow-ups, deal activities
- Wanted quotes attached to People records
- "Opportunities" was immediately clear
- Less interested in Themes/Insights (want specific quotes for deals)

**Quote:**
> P3: "I need to find what a specific person said so I can use it in my proposal. Don't make me dig through 'Insights.'"

## Recommendations

### Navigation Changes

| Current | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Insights → Evidence | **Remove from nav** | Surface via AI/search; show contextually on Themes, People |
| Insights → Custom Lenses | Rename to **"Saved Views"** or **"Templates"** | Clearer purpose |
| Plan → Tasks | Split: **Plan → Research Tasks** | Clarify these are research activities |
| CRM | Add **"Follow-ups"** sub-item | Sales users expect action items here |
| Sources → Surveys | Keep, but add **"Create Survey" in Plan** | Distinguish creation from results |

### Proposed Revised Navigation

```
Plan
├── Context
├── Research Goals
├── Interview Prompts
├── Research Tasks        ← renamed for clarity
└── Create Survey         ← action, not just viewing

Sources
├── Conversations
├── Surveys (Results)     ← clarified
├── Notes
└── Documents

Insights
├── Themes
├── Saved Views           ← renamed from Custom Lenses
└── Reports

CRM
├── People
├── Organizations
├── Opportunities
├── Personas              ← explicit placement
└── Follow-ups            ← for sales users
```

### Evidence Strategy

Don't put Evidence in navigation. Instead:

1. **On Theme cards:** "12 quotes support this theme" → expandable
2. **On People profiles:** "Key quotes from Sarah" section
3. **Via AI:** "Show me quotes about pricing" → instant results
4. **Via Search:** "pricing" → shows quotes in results

### AI Panel Opportunities

Based on user expectations that AI/Search should be central:

1. **Make search/AI input more prominent** — users expect to ask, not navigate
2. **Surface quotes through AI** — "What did customers say about X?"
3. **Task suggestions should be role-aware:**
   - For PMs: "Review 3 unanalyzed interviews"
   - For Sales: "Follow up with Sarah (mentioned budget approval)"

## Confidence Assessment

| Finding | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Plan/Sources/Insights/CRM structure works | **High** | Strong agreement in closed sort |
| "Evidence" needs rethinking | **High** | Consistent confusion across segments |
| "Custom Lenses" name is bad | **High** | Universal confusion |
| Tasks belong in Plan | **Medium** | PMs agree, Sales disagree |
| Sales users need CRM-centric experience | **High** | Consistent pattern |
| AI/Search should be primary interface | **Medium** | Founder segment especially |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run real card sort** to validate these simulated findings
2. **A/B test "Evidence" approaches:**
   - A: Evidence in nav
   - B: Evidence surfaced contextually only
3. **Rename "Custom Lenses"** before any user testing
4. **Consider role-based defaults:**
   - Sales users: CRM as landing page
   - PMs: Insights as landing page
   - Founders: AI chat as landing page
