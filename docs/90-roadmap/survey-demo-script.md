## Recording Notes

- **Tool:** Screen recording (e.g., Screen Studio for Mac — nice zoom/cursor effects)
- **Data:** Use real Startup SD survey as the example (Lisa's community questions)
- **Voiceover:** Record separately, lay over screen capture
- **Music:** Subtle background, fade under voice
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080 minimum, 4K preferred for social crops

## Demo Voice Prompt (paste or speak this)

This is what you say/type into the voice-first survey creator during the recording. It should feel natural and conversational — like you're telling a colleague what you need.

> I'm working with a community called Startup SD. We want to understand why people become members and why sponsors decide to invest. What's drawing them in, what they value most, and what we could do better. We also want to know if members would recommend us and what other communities they're part of — so we can see where we fit. For sponsors specifically, we want to understand what ROI they're seeing and what would make them renew.

This prompt should generate questions like:
1. What originally led you to get involved with Startup SD?
2. What's the single most valuable thing you've gotten from being part of this community?
3. What other communities or organizations are you active in?
4. If you're a sponsor — what motivated you to invest in Startup SD?
5. What ROI or outcomes have you seen from your involvement?
6. What would make you more likely to recommend Startup SD to a colleague?
7. If you could change one thing about the community, what would it be?
8. What would make you renew or deepen your involvement next year?

**Why this prompt works for the demo:**
- It's a real use case (not fake/generic)
- It naturally produces skip logic (sponsor vs. member routing)
- Mix of open-ended + specific = shows question type variety
- The generated questions will look impressive because the prompt is rich with intent

## Example Survey Content (Startup SD / Lisa)

Use this as the demo survey to make it feel real:

**Survey name:** "Startup SD Member & Sponsor Feedback"
**Goal:** Understand why members join and what sponsors value

**Questions:**
1. What led you to join Startup SD?
2. What other organizations or communities do you belong to?
3. What's the single most valuable thing you've gotten from being involved?
4. If you're a sponsor — what made you decide to invest in this community?
5. What would make you more likely to recommend Startup SD to a colleague?
6. Is there anything we should stop doing or change?

**Skip logic example:** If Q4 answer is empty (not a sponsor) → skip to Q5

**Branching demo:** Show the skip logic UI briefly when configuring Q4 → proves the feature without over-explaining it.
