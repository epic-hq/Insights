## SCRIPT

### SCENE 1: The Problem (0-15s)
**VISUAL:** Split screen—person juggling multiple browser tabs, Zoom recordings, scattered notes, Slack messages. Overwhelmed expression.

**VO:**
> "Your customers are telling you exactly what they need. But those insights are buried—scattered across call recordings, surveys, and endless notes. You're drowning in conversations, but starving for clarity."

---

### SCENE 2: The Solution (15-35s)
**VISUAL:** Clean interface. Upload a recording → watch it process → evidence cards appear with timestamps and quotes. Smooth, satisfying animation.

**VO:**
> "Insights changes that. Upload any conversation—interviews, sales calls, support chats—and in minutes, AI extracts the evidence that matters. Not summaries. Receipts. Timestamped quotes you can trust and share."

---

### SCENE 3: The Power (35-55s)
**VISUAL:** Show lens selection (Sales BANT, Customer Discovery, Empathy Map). Then show insights clustering, patterns emerging across segments. Dashboard with clear themes.

**VO:**
> "Apply the right lens for any goal. Qualify leads with BANT. Validate product decisions with discovery insights. See patterns by persona, role, or company size. Every insight links back to what customers actually said."

---

### SCENE 4: The Outcome (55-75s)
**VISUAL:** Team collaboration—insights shared, tasks created, roadmap updated. Fast cuts showing different personas: PM, Sales rep, Founder. Everyone accessing the same truth.

**VO:**
> "Product teams ship the right features. Sales closes faster. Founders make confident decisions. No research jargon. No bottlenecks. Just one source of customer truth your whole team can act on."

---

### SCENE 5: CTA (75-90s)
**VISUAL:** Logo reveal. Clean URL. Simple signup form.

**VO:**
> "Stop guessing. Start knowing. Insights—turn every conversation into your competitive advantage."
