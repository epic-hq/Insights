# UpSight: The Brief

*Creative Direction: Chiat/Day Energy*
*Version: 2.0 | January 2026*

## The Manifesto

Here's to the teams who actually talk to their customers.

The ones who pick up the phone. Who sit in the room. Who listen.

They're not satisfied with dashboards and data lakes.
They want to hear the voice. See the face. Feel the frustration.

But here's the tragedy:

**They listen. They learn. Then they lose it.**

Notes in Notion. Recordings in Zoom. Insights in someone's head.
By the time it matters, nobody can find what they heard.
So they argue. They guess. They build the wrong thing.

Again.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Your company has a hearing problem.

Not a listening problem. Your people listen.
They run calls. They take notes. They care.

**The problem is what happens next.**

Sales hears one thing. Product hears another.
CS knows the customer is frustrated. Nobody else does.
The founder remembers a conversation from three months ago.
Nobody can prove it happened.

**Silos don't just separate departments.**
**They separate your company from the truth.**

Every team has their own version of "what customers want."
Every meeting becomes a debate about whose version is right.
Every decision rides on whoever speaks loudest.

Meanwhile, the customer—the actual human who told you exactly what they need—is forgotten.

---

## The Insight

> **The best companies don't just talk to customers.**
> **They remember.**

Not in spreadsheets. Not in slide decks. Not in someone's brain.

In a living, breathing system that connects every conversation to every decision.

Where sales knows what product learned.
Where CS sees what the founder heard.
Where the customer's voice travels through the entire company—intact.

## What UpSight Is

### The AI-Native CRM That Actually Connects.

Not another database. Not another dashboard.

**A shared reality.**

UpSight captures every customer conversation—calls, notes, tickets, surveys—and turns them into evidence your whole team can see, search, and act on.

Click any insight. See exactly who said it.
Ask any question. Get answers grounded in real conversations.
Make any decision. Know it's backed by what customers actually told you.

**This is what CRM was supposed to be.**

Before it became a place to log activities nobody reads.
Before it became a chore instead of a tool.
Before it became another silo.

UpSight is CRM rebuilt from the ground up for how teams actually work:

- **AI-native.** Not AI-added. Built with intelligence at the core.
- **Conversation-first.** Because customers don't speak in form fields.
- **Team-connected.** One truth, accessible to everyone who needs it.

---

## The Promise

### Make work work.

Three words. One mission.

**Make work work** for the founder who can't be in every meeting.
**Make work work** for the PM who's tired of "we should talk to customers about that."
**Make work work** for the consultant who bills for synthesis, not searching.
**Make work work** for the CS lead who saw the churn signal but couldn't prove it.

When customer truth flows freely, work flows freely.

No more hunting. No more debating. No more "I think I heard..."

Just clarity. Just evidence. Just action.

---

## Who This Is For

### Teams who give a damn.

| They are... | They're tired of... |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Startup founders** (5-50 people) | Losing insights between their ears and their team |
| **Consultants & fractional execs** | Spending more time synthesizing than advising |
| **Product & UX leads** | Research that dies in a deck nobody reads |
| **CS & Success leaders** | Knowing the problem but not being able to prove it |

**Common thread:** They talk to customers. They want it to matter.

### Who this isn't for

- Companies that don't talk to customers (we can't help you)
- Enterprises with 47 existing tools they'll never replace (good luck)
- Anyone looking for "AI magic" without doing the work (there's no shortcut to listening)

---

## The Differentiator

### Everyone else gives you summaries. We give you proof.

| What they sell | What we sell |
|----------------|--------------|
| AI summaries | **Evidence you can verify** |
| Call recordings | **Insights you can act on** |
| Research repositories | **A system that connects teams** |
| CRM databases | **A shared reality** |

**The moat isn't the AI. The moat is the connection.**

- Click any theme → see exactly who said it, when, in what context
- Ask any question → get answers grounded in real conversations
- Share any insight → everyone sees the same truth

**Traceability is trust.**
**Trust is action.**
**Action is results.**

---

## The Competitive Truth

### The market is fragmented. We're integrated.

**Dovetail** is for UX researchers with dedicated research ops.
**Gong** is for sales teams who want call coaching.
**Notion** is for everything, which means it's optimized for nothing.

**UpSight** is for teams who talk to customers and want it to matter.

## The Voice

### Think different. Speak plainly.

**We are:**
- Confident, not arrogant
- Clear, not clever
- Evidence-based, not hype-driven
- The guide, not the hero

**We say:**
- "Here's what customers are actually saying."
- "Every insight shows its receipts."
- "Start with one project. See what you learn."

**We never say:**
- "Revolutionary AI-powered insights"
- "10x your customer understanding"
- "Crush your competition with data"

**Our tone:** A calm, experienced operator who's seen the mess and knows the way out.

---

## The Campaign Concepts

### Concept 1: "Remember"

*Visual: Split screen. Left side: chaotic notes, scattered tools, arguing team. Right side: calm, connected, decisive team.*

**Headline:** Your customers told you everything.
**Subhead:** Do you remember?

**Body:** Every week, your team has dozens of customer conversations. The insights are there. The signals are clear. But by the time you need them, they're gone—scattered across tools, trapped in someone's memory, lost in the noise.

UpSight remembers. So your whole team can act.

**CTA:** Start remembering. →

---

### Concept 2: "One Truth"

*Visual: A single thread connecting multiple people across a company—sales, product, CS, founder—all seeing the same customer insight.*

**Headline:** Sales heard it. Product missed it. CS knew it. Nobody proved it.

**Subhead:** Until now.

**Body:** Customer truth shouldn't depend on who was in the room. UpSight connects every conversation to every team, so everyone sees the same reality.

No more silos. No more "I think I heard..." Just one truth, shared.

**CTA:** See the truth. →

---

### Concept 3: "Receipts"

*Visual: A bold insight statement with a "show receipts" button. Click reveals the exact customer quote, timestamp, context.*

**Headline:** AI can say anything.
**Subhead:** We show the proof.

**Body:** Every AI tool gives you summaries. Only UpSight gives you receipts. Click any insight. See exactly who said it, when, and why it matters.

Trust isn't generated. It's earned.

**CTA:** Get the receipts. →

---

### Concept 4: "Make Work Work"

*Visual: A frustrated team in a meeting, overlaid with the simple phrase "Make work work."*

**Headline:** You're not bad at your job.
**Subhead:** Your tools are bad at theirs.

**Body:** You talk to customers. You take notes. You try to share what you learned. But by the time it matters, the insight is gone—buried in Notion, lost in Slack, forgotten in someone's head.

UpSight makes customer truth flow. So work actually works.

**CTA:** Make it work. →

---

## The Taglines

**Primary:**
> **UpSight. Customer truth, connected.**

**Alternatives:**
- "The CRM that actually remembers."
- "One truth. Every team."
- "From conversation to decision."
- "Make work work."

---

## The Ask

### Start with one project and five conversations.

Not "transform your organization."
Not "integrate with 47 tools."
Not "schedule a demo with our enterprise sales team."

**One project. Five conversations. See what you learn.**

That's the wedge. That's the proof point. That's the moment they realize:

*"Why wasn't it always like this?"*

---

## The Metrics That Matter

| What we measure | Why it matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Time-to-wow | < 33 minutes to see cross-interview synthesis |
| Second project usage | > 60% = real adoption, not trial curiosity |
| "Would you show this to your team?" | Trust is the unlock |
| Referral rate | Teams who give a damn tell other teams who give a damn |

---

## The Bottom Line

**UpSight is not another tool.**

It's the end of the argument about what customers want.
It's the connection between the conversation and the decision.
It's the proof that your team actually listens.

**Customer truth, connected.**

---

*"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the way companies listen to customers... are the ones who do."*

---

## Appendix: The One-Pager

**For:** Teams who talk to customers and want it to matter

**Problem:** Conversations happen. Insights scatter. Decisions ride on opinions.

**Solution:** UpSight—the AI-native CRM that connects every customer conversation to every team decision.

**Differentiator:** Evidence traceability. Click any insight, see exactly who said it. Trust isn't generated—it's proven.

**For whom:**
- Startup founders (5-50 people)
- Consultants & fractional execs
- Product & UX leads without dedicated research teams
- CS leaders who see signals but can't prove them

**The ask:** Start with one project and five conversations.

**The promise:** Make work work.

*This is the brief. Now let's make something people remember.*
