## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Low-Medium

**Why**: Different category and buyer. They're optimizing for call automation efficiency; we're optimizing for research insight quality. Could become a threat if they add analysis/research features, but their core value prop is volume automation, not deep understanding.

**Watch For**:
- Research-specific features
- Analysis layer additions
- Product team positioning
- Integration with research tools
- Video/async capabilities

**Potential Partnership**: Could integrate QCall for participant recruitment/scheduling while we handle the research analysis.
