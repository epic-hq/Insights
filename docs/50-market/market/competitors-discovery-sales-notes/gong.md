## How We Compete

### Direct Comparison

| Feature | Gong | UpSight |
|---------|------|---------|
| Sales call analysis | Best-in-class | Building |
| Product research | No | Yes |
| AI interviewer | No | Yes |
| Voice-first setup | No | Yes |
| Pricing | Enterprise only | Accessible |
| Complexity | High | Low (goal) |

### We DON'T Compete Head-On

Gong owns enterprise sales intelligence. We shouldn't try to out-Gong Gong.

**Our angle**: Customer intelligence for teams that do BOTH sales AND product research.

### Where They Beat Us (Honest Assessment)

| Area | Reality |
|------|---------|
| **Sales analysis** | Best in world, don't compete |
| **Enterprise credibility** | $7B valuation, Gartner leader |
| **Integration depth** | 250+ integrations |
| **Scale** | 4,800 customers, $300M ARR |
| **Data moat** | Millions of analyzed calls |

---

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: LOW (for now)

**Why Low**:
- Different market (sales vs. research)
- Different buyer (VP Sales vs. Product/Research)
- Their complexity is our opportunity
- They won't simplify (enterprise DNA)

**Risk Scenario**: If Gong adds "product research mode" or acquires a research tool.

**Watch For**:
- Product team features
- Acquisition of research tools
- SMB/startup pricing tier
- Simplified product offering

## Patterns to Learn From

1. **Role-Based Views**: Different dashboards per persona
2. **"Ask Anything"**: Natural language search (400% growth)
3. **Automatic Capture**: Zero-friction recording
4. **Emotional Analytics**: Sentiment beyond words
5. **Highlight Reels**: Shareable moment collections
