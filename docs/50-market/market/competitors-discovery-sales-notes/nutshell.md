## How We Beat Them

### Strategy 1: Depth of Analysis

**Their Approach**: Summaries of individual meetings
**Our Approach**: Cross-meeting pattern analysis, structured frameworks

| Feature | Nutshell | UpSight |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Meeting summaries | Yes | Yes |
| Cross-meeting themes | No | Yes |
| Research frameworks (Lenses) | No | Yes |
| Evidence extraction | No | Yes |
| AI-conducted interviews | No | Yes |

### Strategy 2: Both Sales AND Product Teams

**Their Approach**: CRM-centric, sales-first
**Our Approach**: Customer intelligence for product AND sales

### Strategy 3: Voice-First Research

**Their Approach**: Record meetings
**Our Approach**: Conduct research via voice agent

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Medium

**Why Medium**:
- Different core product (CRM vs. research platform)
- But their AI features overlap with our sales use cases
- If we target sales teams, they're a competitor

**Key Risk**: If user wants "CRM with meeting notes," Nutshell wins on integration.

|------|----------|---------|
| CRM functionality | Full CRM | None (we integrate) |
| Pipeline management | Native | Not our focus |
| SMB simplicity | Very strong | We need to prove this |
| Price point | $13-79/mo | TBD |
| Market presence | Established | Early stage |
