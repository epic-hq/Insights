```
1. Connect calendar → Clarify detects meetings
2. Meeting starts → AI joins, records, transcribes
3. Meeting ends → Key info extracted automatically:
   - Action items identified
   - Deal blockers flagged
   - Budget/timeline captured

## How We Beat Them

### Strategy 1: Research + Sales (They're Sales Only)

**Their Approach**: CRM automation for sales
**Our Approach**: Customer intelligence for sales AND product

| Feature | Clarify | UpSight |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Sales call analysis | Yes | Yes |
| Product research | No | Yes |
| User interview frameworks | No | Yes (Lenses) |
| AI-conducted interviews | No | Yes |
| Cross-team insights | No | Yes |

### Strategy 2: Structured Analysis

**Their Approach**: Extract deal info from conversations
**Our Approach**: Extract insights using research frameworks

### Strategy 3: Voice-First Experience

**Our Approach**: Conversational setup and research

---

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Medium

**Why Medium**:
- Different core value prop (CRM automation vs. research insights)
- But their "Ask Meeting" overlaps with our search/query features
- If targeting startups doing customer research, they're adjacent

**Key Risk**: Startups might use Clarify for "good enough" conversation insights.
