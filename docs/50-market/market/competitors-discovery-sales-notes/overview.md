## AppSumo-listed Typeform alternatives (strengths & weaknesses)

### Bit Form – WordPress Form Builder Plugin

- **Strengths**:
  - WordPress-native form builder (good fit if your workflow is already WP-centric)
  - Broad feature set: conditional logic, conversational forms, multi-step/multi-column, analytics, file upload

  - Emphasis on real-time analytics and “zero-party data” capture

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Quiz/funnel-oriented product; may be less appropriate for operational/internal form workflows

### Deftform

### Contact Button

- **Strengths**:
  - Adds a “widget menu” to sites with multiple interaction modes (contact forms, subscriptions, hours, etc.)
  - Useful for lead capture across a site without building a full form system
  - Integrates with common tools (e.g. Calendly, Mailchimp, WordPress)

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Not a direct Typeform replacement for multi-step form/survey design; it’s a website engagement widget
  - Deal terms note each workspace supports a single login (multi-user not currently available)
