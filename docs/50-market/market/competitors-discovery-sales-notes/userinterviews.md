## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: NONE (Complementary)

**Why None**:
- Different problem space (recruiting vs. analysis)
- They don't analyze; we don't recruit
- Natural partnership opportunity

**Integration Opportunity**:
- API for pushing recruitment criteria
- Webhook for when participants are scheduled
- Pull scheduling data for interview prep

**Watch For**:
- If they add analysis features
- If they add AI interviewer
- If they build their own insights layer

---

## Patterns to Learn From

1. **Per-Session Pricing**: Clear unit economics
2. **Panel Management**: How they handle opt-ins and fatigue
3. **Screener Design**: Their qualification question patterns
4. **Incentive Handling**: 3% fee is elegant
5. **API-First**: Enables tool ecosystem

---

## Our Honest Position

**We should NOT compete on recruiting.**

User Interviews has:
- 6M participants
- Years of fraud prevention
- Deep integrations
- Established trust

**Our strategy**: Integrate with recruiting platforms, focus on what happens AFTER you have participants.
