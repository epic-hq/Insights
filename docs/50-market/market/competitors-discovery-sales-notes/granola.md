## How We Beat Them

### Strategy 1: Research Analysis vs. Note-Taking

**Our Advantage**: Granola creates notes; we surface insights across conversations.

**Tactics**:
- "One meeting = notes. Many meetings = insights."
- Show cross-conversation pattern analysis
- Emphasize theme clustering and evidence extraction

**Feature Comparison**:
| Feature | Granola | UpSight |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cross-meeting analysis | No | Yes |
| Theme extraction | No | Yes (Lenses) |
| Evidence repository | No | Yes |
| Research frameworks | No | Yes |

### Strategy 2: AI That Asks Questions

**Our Advantage**: Their AI transcribes; our AI conducts conversations.

**Tactics**:
- "Don't just record research - let AI run it"
- Emphasize LiveKit voice agent capabilities
- Show automated interview moderation

### Strategy 3: Team Research Workflows

**Our Advantage**: Built for collaborative research, not individual productivity.

**Tactics**:
- Shared insights repository
- Team-wide pattern visibility
- Stakeholder-friendly views (not just researcher tools)

## UX Patterns to Learn From

### What They Do Right

1. **No-Bot Recording**: System audio capture - invisible to participants
2. **Note Enhancement**: AI augments user's notes, doesn't replace them
3. **Gray vs. Black Text**: Visual differentiation between user notes and AI additions
4. **Recipes**: Templated prompts for specific outputs (brilliant UX pattern)
5. **Calendar-Triggered Workflows**: Auto-notify before meetings, one-click start
6. **Native App Feel**: Not a web wrapper - truly polished desktop experience
7. **"Dancing Bars" Visualizer**: Subtle audio feedback animation

### What We Should Adopt

- **Recipes/Templates**: Pre-built analysis prompts for common research outputs
- **Visual Differentiation**: Clear distinction between user input and AI enhancement
- **One-Click Workflows**: Minimize steps from intent to action
- **Native Feeling**: Even if web-based, should feel as polished

## Marketing Tactics

### Differentiation Messaging

| Their Claim | Our Counter |
|-------------|-------------|
| "AI notepad for meetings" | "AI platform for research insights" |
| "Enhances your notes" | "Discovers patterns you'd miss" |
| "For back-to-back meetings" | "For systematic customer understanding" |

### Target Different Workflow

- Granola: High-frequency meeting participants (sales, managers)
- UpSight: Researchers conducting structured interviews

---

## Feature Roadmap Implications

### Learn From
- **Recipes pattern**: Implement templated analysis prompts
- **No-bot recording**: Consider audio capture approaches
- **Calendar integration**: Smart meeting detection and preparation

### Differentiate On
- Multi-conversation analysis
- Structured research frameworks (lenses)
- Team collaboration features

---

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Low

**Why**: Different product category (personal productivity vs. research platform). Could add team features, but their core DNA is individual note-enhancement.

**Watch For**:
- Team/collaborative features
- Research-specific templates
- Pattern analysis across meetings
