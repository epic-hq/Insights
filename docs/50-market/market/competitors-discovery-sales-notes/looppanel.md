| AI note-taking | Yes | Yes |
| AI interviewer | No | Yes |
| Voice-first setup | No | Yes |
| Research lenses | No | Yes |

### Strategy 2: Voice-First Experience

**Tactics**:
- "Set up research by talking"
- Demo voice setup comparison
- Emphasize natural conversation flow

### Strategy 3: Structured Frameworks

**Our Advantage**: Lenses provide structured analysis frameworks.

**Tactics**:
- Show lens-based analysis vs. generic tagging
- Pre-built frameworks for common research needs

## UX Patterns to Learn From

### What They Do Right

1. **Question-Grouped Analysis**: All notes organized by interview question (brilliant)
2. **Traceability**: Every AI output has source link (trust-building)
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Easy editing of AI suggestions
4. **Free Stakeholder Access**: Unlimited viewers, embedded clips
5. **Collaborative Notes**: Stakeholders can take notes during calls
6. **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries across repository
7. **Jira Embeds**: Evidence directly in engineering tickets

### What We Should Adopt

- **Question-Grouped Analysis**: Organize insights by interview question
- **Traceability Design**: Always show source for AI outputs
- **Free Stakeholder Access**: Don't charge for viewers
- **Jira/Ticket Embedding**: Make evidence actionable in dev tools
- **Collaborative Live Notes**: Let stakeholders participate

## Marketing Tactics

### Differentiation Messaging

| Their Claim | Our Counter |
|-------------|-------------|
| "AI Analysis & Repository" | "AI Collection, Analysis & Repository" |
| "Automated transcription & notes" | "Automated research, end-to-end" |
| "Skip copy-pasting to Miro" | "Skip conducting research manually" |

### Target Overlap

Both target UX researchers and product teams. Differentiate on:
- AI-conducted interviews (they don't have)
- Voice-first experience (they don't have)
- Structured lenses (they use generic tagging)

---

## Feature Roadmap Implications

### Learn From
- Question-grouped analysis (implement this)
- Traceability for all AI outputs
- Free stakeholder access model
- Jira/ticket embedding
- Semantic search UX

### Differentiate On
- AI voice agent for interviews
- Voice-first setup experience
- Structured research lenses
- End-to-end research workflow

---

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Medium-High

**Why**: Very similar target user (UX researchers). Strong product with researcher-focused design. Could add AI interviewer features.

**Our Opportunity**: They don't collect; we do. Voice-first is genuine differentiator.

**Watch For**:
- AI interviewer features
- Voice input capabilities
- Framework/lens additions
- Enterprise expansion
