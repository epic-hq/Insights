## How We Compete

### Direct Comparison

| Feature | Dovetail | UpSight |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Research repository | Yes, mature | Building |
| AI analysis | Yes, but accuracy issues | Building |
| AI interviewer | **No** | **Yes (LiveKit)** |
| Voice-first setup | **No** | **Yes** |
| Stakeholder UX | Complex | Designed for simplicity |
| Pricing | Hidden, enterprise | TBD (must be transparent) |
| Collection + Analysis | Analysis only | **Both** |

### Where We Must Win

1. **Voice-First**: They don't have it, we must nail it
2. **AI Interviewer**: Our key differentiator
3. **Stakeholder Access**: Simple views for non-researchers
4. **Speed to Insight**: Faster than their workflow
5. **Pricing Transparency**: Publish pricing, no sales calls required

### Where They Beat Us (Honest Assessment)

| Area | Reality |
|------|---------|
| **Market presence** | They have brand, we're unknown |
| **Integration ecosystem** | 50+ integrations vs. our few |
| **Enterprise features** | SSO, compliance, audit logs |
| **Funding** | $57M vs. our limited resources |
