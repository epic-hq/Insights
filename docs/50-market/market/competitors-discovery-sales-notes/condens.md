## How We Beat Them

### Strategy 1: Collection + Repository

**Our Advantage**: Condens stores and analyzes; we also collect.

**Tactics**:
- "From conversation to repository in one platform"
- Emphasize LiveKit voice agent for collection
- Show end-to-end workflow

**Feature Comparison**:
| Feature | Condens | UpSight |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Repository | Yes | Yes |
| AI analysis | Yes | Yes |
| AI interviewer | No | Yes |
| Voice-first | No | Yes |
| Two interfaces | Yes | Planned |

### Strategy 2: Voice-First Experience

**Our Advantage**: They require manual data entry; we start with voice.

**Tactics**:
- "Set up research by talking"
- Demo conversational onboarding
- Emphasize speed-to-value

### Strategy 3: Deeper AI

**Our Advantage**: Our AI conducts research; theirs assists with analysis.

**Tactics**:
- "AI that researches, not just organizes"
- Show agent capabilities
- Emphasize proactive insights vs. reactive tagging

## UX Patterns to Learn From

### What They Do Right

1. **Two Interfaces**: Researcher view vs. stakeholder view (brilliant)
2. **Minimal Archive Friction**: Click to publish, no extra work
3. **Participant Attributes**: Segment-based pattern detection
4. **Note + Whiteboard**: Multiple analysis styles
5. **Artifacts System**: Flexible output containers
6. **Research-First Design**: Built from researcher interviews

### What We Should Adopt

- **Two Interfaces**: Critical - implement researcher vs. stakeholder views
- **Minimal Archive Friction**: Make publishing/sharing one click
- **Participant Segmentation**: Enable segment-based analysis
- **Flexible Outputs**: Multiple formats for insights (docs, boards, etc.)

## Marketing Tactics

### Differentiation Messaging

| Their Claim | Our Counter |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Repository that scales" | "Research platform that scales" |
| "Single source of truth" | "Single source of insight" |
| "Import all data" | "Collect all data" |

### Target Overlap

Both target UX researchers. Differentiate on:
- AI-conducted interviews (they don't have)
- Voice-first setup (they don't have)
- Proactive AI (theirs is reactive)

---

## Feature Roadmap Implications

### Learn From
- **Two Interfaces**: Must implement (researcher + stakeholder)
- Minimal archive friction
- Participant segmentation for patterns
- Flexible output formats (artifacts)

### Differentiate On
- AI voice agent for collection
- Voice-first experience
- Proactive AI insights
- End-to-end research workflow

---

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level**: Medium

**Why**: Smart design decisions, researcher-focused. Could add collection, but repository is their core.

**Our Opportunity**: They don't collect. Two-interface design is worth learning from.

**Watch For**:
- Collection feature additions
- AI interviewer development
- US market expansion
- Enterprise features
