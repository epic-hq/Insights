## 1. Strategic Framing

Consulting is a beachhead, not a company pivot.

Why this framing is correct:
- Fastest path to paid validation
- Clear ROI model tied to billable time
- Short decision cycle (especially solo and boutique consultants)
- High-signal feedback from users with low tolerance for fluff

Positioning rule:
- Treat consultant discovery as the proving ground for the core UpSight value proposition.
- Avoid building a consulting-only feature suite until demand and retention signals are proven.

Decision rule:
- If 5+ consultants convert and actively reuse within 60 days, invest in consulting-specific enhancements.
- If adoption is weak after 60 days, keep consultants as a secondary segment and refocus messaging and roadmap.

---

## 2. Market and Segment Reality

Primary segment:
- Solo consultants, fractional leaders, and boutique practices (1-50 people)

Why this segment first:
- Economic pain is immediate and measurable
- Budget owner and daily user are often the same person
- Discovery synthesis burden is high and repeated across engagements
- Existing tool stack is fragmented (notes + recordings + docs + ad hoc AI prompting)

Core market claim:
- Consultants do not need better note capture alone.
- They need faster, defensible decisions that survive client and leadership challenge.

---

## 3. Persona Map (Buyer, User, Influencers)

### Buyer: Practice Lead / Managing Partner
Primary concerns:
- Margin leakage from discovery rework
- Inconsistent quality across consultants
- Recommendation credibility with executive clients
- Faster project progression from discovery to approved scope

Success metric:
- Fewer write-offs, faster approvals, stronger repeat business.

### User: Engagement Lead / Senior Consultant / Fractional Operator
Primary concerns:
- Time-heavy synthesis across multiple stakeholders
- Conflicting stakeholder input and unclear priorities
- Client challenge: "where did this recommendation come from?"
- Need to produce confident outputs under deadline

Success metric:
- Decision-ready discovery outputs in hours, not weeks.

### Influencers: Delivery Leaders, Client Sponsors
Primary concerns:
- Confidence in scope boundaries and assumptions
- Risk visibility before implementation
- Clarity on ownership, milestones, and dependencies

---

## 4. Jobs-To-Be-Done and Pain Hierarchy

Primary job:
- Turn messy stakeholder conversations into defensible decisions that drive scope and implementation.

Top pain hierarchy:
1. Recommendation gets challenged and cannot be defended with evidence.
2. Scope and SOW need rework because alignment issues surfaced too late.
3. Senior consultants lose leverage to low-value synthesis work.
4. Implementation plan fails to reflect stakeholder constraints.

Critical correction:
- "Meeting assistant" is not the core problem framing.
- "Decision defensibility and delivery economics" is the core framing.

---

## 5. Positioning

Category:
- Customer Intelligence Platform (consulting use case: discovery-to-decision workflow)

Positioning statement:
- UpSight turns stakeholder conversations into defensible decisions, fast.

Consulting-specific translation:
- Every recommendation backed by evidence.
- Every risk traceable to stakeholder voice.

What we are not:
- Not a generic note taker
- Not just a research repository
- Not a generic AI drafting copilot

What we are:
- Cross-conversation synthesis plus evidence traceability for decision-grade outputs.

---

## 6. Differentiation and Moat

Non-differentiators (commoditizing):
- Transcription
- Basic summaries
- Generic AI drafting

Defensible differentiation:
- Source-linked evidence traceability
- Cross-stakeholder synthesis (not one-call summaries)
- Role-aware interpretation (leadership vs delivery vs user perspectives)
- Decision-ready outputs tied to engagement outcomes

Moat statement:
- Anyone can summarize. Few can prove.

---

## 7. Offer and Product Scope

MVP scope (consultant wedge):
1. Multi-interview synthesis
2. Theme-to-evidence linking
3. Alignment/conflict visibility across stakeholders
4. Editable, client-ready exports (discovery brief and planning artifacts)

Defer until validated:
- Full SOW generator
- Heavy template suite
- Complex stakeholder matrix features
- Niche consulting-framework automation

Output framing:
- Lead with "decision-ready discovery brief" and "SOW inputs"
- Avoid positioning full SOW generation as the hero promise

---

## 8. Proof and Pricing Narrative

Economic proof model:
- 8-12 hours reclaimed per project
- Typical consultant rates: $150-$300/hour
- Estimated project value recovered: $1,200-$3,600

Pricing narrative principle:
- Sell billable recovery and reduced rework risk, not AI features.

Messaging example:
- "If this saves one rework cycle, it can pay for itself in a single project."

---

## 9. Web Copy Guidance (Consultant Core Page)

Page objective:
- Convert consultant and practice-lead traffic seeking help with stakeholder discovery, scope confidence, and implementation planning.

Recommended section order:
1. Hero: decision defensibility + engagement economics
2. Top concerns: rework, challenge risk, low-leverage synthesis
3. Outcome proof: time/margin/rework economics
4. Workflow: stakeholder voice -> alignment map -> discovery brief -> SOW/implementation inputs
5. Differentiation: why generic summaries and repositories fail this job
6. Deliverables: what they walk away with
7. FAQ: objections (trust, defensibility, workflow fit, pricing value)

Copy rules:
- Lead with buyer risk, not feature description.
- Use economic language and defensibility language in every major section.
- Keep "not a meeting assistant" as supporting context, never the headline.
- Tie every claim to outcomes a client-facing consultant can defend.

## 10. SEO Strategy: Core Page + Clusters

Core page:
- `/customer-discovery-for-consultants`
- Primary intent: consultants needing faster, defensible stakeholder discovery and implementation planning.

Clusters to build next (high-intent + conversion-aligned):

1. Discovery-to-SOW Execution
- Topics:
- "how to turn stakeholder interviews into a SOW"
- "consulting discovery brief template"
- "scope definition from stakeholder interviews"

2. Stakeholder Alignment and Decision Defensibility
- Topics:
- "how to handle conflicting stakeholder requirements"
- "evidence-based recommendations for consulting teams"
- "stakeholder alignment framework for transformation projects"

3. Consulting Delivery Economics and Rework Reduction
- Topics:
- "reduce consulting rework in discovery phase"
- "billable vs non-billable synthesis time"
- "consulting margin leakage in project discovery"

4. Implementation Planning from Customer Intelligence
- Topics:
- "implementation plan template for consulting engagements"
- "translate discovery findings into workstreams and milestones"
- "consulting risk register from stakeholder interviews"

5. Consultant Operating System (AI-Native, Human-Centric)
- Topics:
- "AI for consultants without losing human judgment"
- "customer intelligence workflow for boutique consulting firms"
- "human-centric AI consulting toolkit"

Content format for cluster pages:
- Direct answer in first 5-10 lines
- Clear "when to use / when not"
- Practical steps/checklist
- Real examples and templates
- FAQ with objections
- Internal links to core consultant page and related cluster pages

---

## 11. Operating Cadence

Weekly:
- Review GSC impressions with low CTR and improve title/meta
- Run one internal-link pass from new content to core consultant page
- Capture objection language from calls and update FAQ copy

Monthly:
- Refresh two top pages with updated examples and proof points
- Publish one citation-magnet asset (template, benchmark, framework)
- Review conversion from consultant-intent pages to signup/demo actions

---

## 12. Assumptions to Validate

Validation priorities (via interview script and live usage):
1. Does "decision defensibility" language consistently resonate?
2. Do consultants prefer "discovery brief + SOW inputs" over full SOW generation?
3. What minimum proof is needed to justify paid adoption?
4. Which output format drives fastest client acceptance (doc, deck, worksheet)?

If assumptions fail:
- Revise language based on consultant-native wording
- Tighten MVP scope further
- Reassess segment priority vs founder-led use case
