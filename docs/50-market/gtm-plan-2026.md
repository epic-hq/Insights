## Executive Summary

UpSight is a customer intelligence platform that turns customer conversations into evidence-backed decisions. We are pre-scale, seeking product-market fit with initial users. This GTM plan prioritizes **founder-led distribution**, **network-first outreach** (Southern California + cybersecurity industry contacts), and **low-cost organic channels** supplemented by targeted paid experiments.

### The Strategy in One Sentence

**Validate with consultants and founders through direct outreach and demos, build organic traffic through LinkedIn thought leadership and SEO content, then amplify with a Product Hunt launch and targeted paid channels.**

### Key Principles

- **Network first, ads second.** Initial traction comes from personal relationships, demos, and word-of-mouth — not paid acquisition.
- **Founder-led content.** The founder's LinkedIn presence is the #1 marketing asset at this stage.
- **Evidence over hype.** Our brand voice is direct, grounded, and outcome-first. No "AI-powered revolutionary" language.
- **Prove ROI fast.** Every interaction should demonstrate the $1,200-3,600/project ROI for consultants or the time-to-insight improvement for PMs/founders.
- **Measure everything.** Track CPL, activation, and conversion by channel from day one.

---

## Strategic Context

### Where We Are

- Product built with core capabilities (voice-first setup, AI analysis, evidence traceability, research lenses)
- ~30 existing signups to nurture
- No meaningful organic traffic yet
- Strong positioning docs and competitive understanding in place
- PLG infrastructure built (PostHog events, Brevo email sequences, cohort-based nurture)

### What We Need

- 20-50 active users validating core value proposition
- 5-10 paying customers (consultant and/or founder persona)
- Evidence of retention (second project created within 30 days)
- Organic traffic growth trajectory (500+ monthly visitors within 90 days)
- Clear signal on which persona converts best

### Competitive Landscape Summary

| Competitor | Threat Level | Our Differentiation |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **VoicePanel** (YC W24) | HIGH | Human+AI hybrid vs. AI-only; multi-source input; evidence traceability |
| **Dovetail** ($57M raised) | HIGH | Simpler UX for non-researchers; pricing transparency; voice-first |
| **Looppanel** | MEDIUM-HIGH | End-to-end research (collect + analyze); structured lenses vs. generic tagging |
| **Clarify** ($15M seed) | MEDIUM | Product + Sales teams, not just sales; research frameworks |
| **Gong** ($300M+ ARR) | LOW | Different market; we serve PMs/founders, not sales coaching |

**Our whitespace:** Voice-first + Human+AI hybrid + Evidence traceability + Cross-source synthesis + Action connection. No single competitor has all five.

## Target Personas & Beachhead Sequence

### Phase 1: Consultants & Fractional Executives (Beachhead — Months 1-3)

**Why first:** Clear ROI math, buy alone (no procurement), fast feedback loop, zero tolerance for fluff.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Solo consultants, fractional CXOs, boutique firms (1-50 people) |
| **Pain** | 2-4 weeks synthesizing stakeholder interviews; margin leakage from non-billable synthesis; recommendations challenged without evidence |
| **Promise** | "From stakeholder interviews to defensible recommendations in hours, not weeks" |
| **ROI** | 8-12 hours saved per project at $150-300/hr = **$1,200-3,600 per project** |
| **Price sensitivity** | $99/month pays for itself in one project |
| **Where to find them** | LinkedIn, fractional exec networks (GigX, Fractional Executive Collective), Pavilion, consulting Slacks, SoCal cybersecurity networks |
| **Activation trigger** | Record next client meeting or upload stakeholder interviews |

### Phase 2: Post-Launch Founders with Weak Traction (Months 2-4)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Founders with <$10K MRR, <18 months runway, product shipped but growth stalled |
| **Pain** | Need clarity on pivot-or-persevere; 10-30 conversations sitting unanalyzed |
| **Promise** | "Find what customers are trying to tell you" |
| **Where to find them** | StartupSD, Indie Hackers, r/startups, r/SaaS, X #BuildInPublic, accelerator networks |
| **Activation trigger** | Upload existing customer conversations |

### Phase 3: Product Managers Without Research Teams (Months 3-6)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | PMs/product leads at 10-50 person companies, no dedicated UX researcher |
| **Pain** | Research dies in slide decks; insights trapped in people's heads; HiPPO decisions |
| **Promise** | "Research that doesn't die in a slide deck" |
| **Where to find them** | LinkedIn, Lenny's Slack, Mind the Product, Product School, ProductCon |
| **Activation trigger** | Create first project + import customer data |

### Phase 4: Technical Consultants & Agencies (Months 4-6)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Software/AI consultants building products for clients; need clear requirements |
| **Pain** | Requirements get lost between discovery and implementation; scope creep from unclear customer needs |
| **Promise** | "Turn client conversations into clear requirements" |
| **Where to find them** | LinkedIn, consulting communities, tech meetups, r/consulting |
| **Activation trigger** | Upload client interview or run guided discovery session |

---

## Positioning & Messaging

### Core Positioning

> **UpSight transforms customer conversations into evidence-backed decisions so teams stop debating and start shipping what customers actually need.**

**Tagline:** "Get your customers. Build conviction."

**Category:** Customer Intelligence Platform (not CRM, not research repository, not call recorder)

### Messaging by Persona

| Persona | Primary Message | Supporting Message | CTA |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Consultants** | "From stakeholder interviews to defensible recommendations in hours, not weeks" | "Every recommendation backed by evidence. Every risk traceable to a voice." | "Record your next client meeting" |
| **Founders** | "Stop debating what customers want. Know." | "One place where every customer conversation becomes evidence you can act on." | "Upload your customer conversations" |
| **Product Managers** | "Research that doesn't die in a slide deck" | "Insights with receipts. Evidence that connects to decisions." | "Start your evidence library" |
| **Tech Consultants** | "Turn client conversations into clear requirements" | "From discovery calls to implementation specs, grounded in what stakeholders said." | "Run your next discovery session" |

### We Say / We Don't Say

| We Say | We Don't Say |
|--------|-------------|
| "Here's what customers said" | "AI-powered insights" |
| "See the source" | "Unlock the power of" |
| "Build the right thing" | "10x your customer understanding" |
| "Proof you can point to" | "Actionable intelligence" |
| "Get your customers" | "Leverage voice-of-customer" |
| "Build conviction" | "Drive alignment" |

## Channel Strategy

### LinkedIn Strategy (Primary Channel)

**Organic (Founder-Led):**

The founder's personal LinkedIn account is the single most important marketing asset. The company page will get 5-10x less reach.

Weekly cadence:
- **Monday:** Insight/observation post (customer research pain, evidence gap)
- **Tuesday:** Engage on others' content (no post — comment on 10+ relevant posts)
- **Wednesday:** Carousel or framework post (visual, educational)
- **Thursday:** Behind-the-scenes / build-in-public update
- **Friday:** Question or poll to spark discussion

Content formats ranked by effectiveness:
1. Text-only posts with line breaks (highest reach)
2. Carousel documents / PDFs (high dwell time)
3. Short native video 60-90s (underused in B2B = bonus reach)
4. Polls (easy engagement)
5. External links (lowest — LinkedIn suppresses outbound links)

**Paid LinkedIn Ads:**

Targeting:
- Job titles: Product Manager, UX Researcher, Founder/CEO (<200 employees), Management Consultant
- Company size: 11-200 employees
- Skills: Customer Discovery, User Research, Product Strategy, JTBD
- Industries: Technology, SaaS, Consulting

Ad formats to test:
1. Sponsored Content (single image) → lead magnet landing page
2. Document Ads (carousel that ends with CTA)
3. Video Ads (30-60s product demo)

Expected costs:
| Metric | Range |
|--------|-------|
| CPC | $5-12 |
| CPL | $50-200 |
| Cost per demo | $150-500 |

### Direct Outreach Strategy (Southern California + Cybersecurity)

**Phase 1: Network Activation (Weeks 1-4)**

1. Export LinkedIn connections and identify:
   - Cybersecurity industry contacts who do consulting/advisory
   - SoCal startup founders and product leaders
   - Fractional executives and consultants in your network
   - People at companies doing customer research without dedicated tools

2. Personal outreach template (adapt per relationship):
   > "Hey [Name], I've been building something I'd love your take on. We're turning customer conversations into evidence-backed decisions — think of it as a way to stop losing insights from stakeholder interviews. Would you have 20 minutes for a demo? Happy to show you how it works and get your honest feedback."

3. Target: 10-20 personalized outreach messages per week from founder's account. Expect 15-25% response rate.

**Phase 2: Demo-to-Conversion (Ongoing)**

- Run 3-5 demos per week
- Use the "research frame": position demos as learning conversations, not sales pitches
- After demo, offer guided onboarding: help them upload their first interviews
- Follow up with evidence of value (time saved, patterns found)

**Phase 3: SoCal Community Presence**

- Attend StartupSD 1st Mondays networking (monthly)
- Present at SD Tech Founders meetup
- Engage with Exceptional Entrepreneurs weekly meetings
- Connect with OWASP San Diego, ISSA San Diego, BSides SD for cybersecurity contacts
- Attend TechCon SoCal (May 22-23, 2026 at SDSU)

### Reddit Strategy

**Do:**
- Answer questions genuinely in r/productmanagement, r/userexperience, r/UXResearch, r/startups, r/SaaS
- Share frameworks and research insights as self-posts (not links)
- Build karma and reputation over 8-12 weeks before any "I built this" posts
- Post "I built this" in r/SaaS and r/startups after month 3 with transparency about journey

**Don't:**
- Post links to your product in comments
- Create thinly veiled ads
- Cross-post the same content to multiple subreddits simultaneously

### X Strategy

- Build-in-public weekly updates on UpSight's journey
- Post threads on customer research / evidence-based product decisions
- Engage with PM/founder influencers: Lenny Rachitsky, Teresa Torres, Shreyas Doshi, Des Traynor
- Use hashtags sparingly: #BuildInPublic, #SaaS, #ProductManagement, #CustomerResearch
- Cadence: 1-2 tweets/day, 1 thread/week

| Trial → Paid conversion | 25%+ |
| 30-day retention | 40%+ |

### Kill Criteria

- **If no consultant reuses on a second project by month 3** → Reassess consultant beachhead; pivot to founders
- **If CPL on LinkedIn Ads > $300 after 60 days of testing** → Pause ads, shift budget to content and SEO
- **If trial → paid < 10% after 50+ trials** → Reassess pricing, value delivery, or target persona
