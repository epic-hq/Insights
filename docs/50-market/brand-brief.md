# UpSight Brand Brief

> **Document Purpose**: Strategic foundation for all marketing, sales, and product communications
> **Version**: 1.0 | **Date**: February 2026
> **Status**: Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

UpSight is a conversation-first customer intelligence platform that transforms scattered customer conversations into **defensible decisions**. Unlike tools that generate AI summaries, UpSight provides **evidence with receipts**—every insight links back to who said it, when, and in what context.

**One-sentence positioning**: The AI-native CRM that makes customer truth visible, searchable, and actionable across your entire team.

---

## 1. Brand Foundation

### 1.1 Brand Purpose (Why We Exist)

**Your company has a hearing problem.**

Not a listening problem—your people listen. They pick up the phone. They sit in the room. They run the interviews. The problem is what happens next.

They listen. They learn. **Then they lose it.**

Notes in Notion. Recordings in Zoom. Insights locked in someone's head. By the time it matters, nobody can find what they heard. Teams argue, guess, and build the wrong thing. Sales hears one thing. Product hears another. CS knows the customer is frustrated. Nobody else does.

**UpSight exists to solve this.** We turn scattered customer conversations into evidence your whole team can see, search, and act on.

### 1.2 Brand Vision

To become the **institutional memory** for customer-centric organizations—the AI-powered "Chief of Staff" that knows everything about your customers and makes that knowledge accessible through natural conversation.

### 1.3 Brand Mission

Make customer truth the foundation for every decision by capturing every interaction, synthesizing what matters, and connecting insights to action.

### 1.4 Brand Promise

**Every insight shows its receipts.**

We don't just tell you what customers think. We show you exactly who said it, when they said it, and in what context—so you can trust it, share it, and act on it.

## 2. Target Audience

### 2.1 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Company Size** | 5-50 people |
| **Customer Contact Frequency** | Weekly (not quarterly research projects) |
| **Work Style** | Distributed or async (can't rely on hallway conversations) |
| **Budget Reality** | Resource-constrained (no budget for Dovetail + Gong + dedicated researcher) |
| **Decision Proximity** | Decision-makers or close to them |

### 2.2 Primary Personas

#### Persona 1: Startup Founder
- **Pain**: Losing insights between their ears and their team
- **Goal**: Make faster, more confident product and GTM decisions
- **Message**: "Stop debating what customers want. Know."

#### Persona 2: Consultant / Fractional Executive
- **Pain**: Spending more time synthesizing than advising
- **Goal**: Turn stakeholder interviews into defensible recommendations
- **Message**: "From stakeholder interviews to defensible recommendations in hours, not weeks."

#### Persona 3: Product / UX Lead (at companies without dedicated researchers)
- **Pain**: Research that dies in a slide deck nobody reads
- **Goal**: Connect customer evidence to product decisions
- **Message**: "Research that doesn't die in a slide deck."

#### Persona 4: Customer Success Leader
- **Pain**: Knowing the problem but not being able to prove it
- **Goal**: Surface churn signals and cross-team alignment
- **Message**: "See churn signals before they become churn."

### 2.3 Anti-Personas (Who This Isn't For)

- Companies that don't talk to customers
- Enterprises with 47 existing tools they'll never replace
- Anyone looking for "AI magic" without doing the work
- Enterprise teams with dedicated research ops (8+ person teams)
- Sales-only orgs who just want call coaching

## 3. Market Context

### 3.1 Category Definition

**Customer Intelligence Platform** (conversation-first CRM for Product + Sales)

We occupy the whitespace between research tools and sales tools:

```
RESEARCH TOOLS ──────────────► SALES TOOLS
(Dovetail, Looppanel)          (Gong, Chorus)
    Optimize for LEARNING          Optimize for COACHING

              ↓ UpSight ↓

         WHITESPACE
    Optimize for DECISIONS
    (Small teams, All roles, Action-first)
```

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Their Focus | Our Angle |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Dovetail** | Research repository for UX teams | For teams without dedicated researchers |
| **Gong/Chorus** | Sales call coaching | For product + CS + founders, not just sales |
| **Looppanel** | Interview analysis | End-to-end: capture → synthesize → act |
| **Notion + AI** | General docs with AI | Purpose-built for customer evidence |
| **Otter/Fathom** | Transcription | Synthesis + traceability, not just notes |

### 3.3 Competitive Moat

**What's easy to copy:**
- Transcription (commodity)
- AI summaries (everyone has GPT)
- Pretty dashboards

**What's hard to copy (our moat):**
- **Evidence traceability** – Click any theme → see exactly who said it
- **Cross-source synthesis** – Calls + tickets + notes + surveys, unified
- **Role-aware analysis** – CEO vs. end user perspectives, distinguished
- **Action integration** – Insights → tasks → outcomes, connected

## 4. Brand Positioning

### 4.1 Positioning Statement

**For** small teams who talk to customers constantly but lose insights across tools,

**UpSight is** a customer intelligence platform

**That** turns scattered conversations into defensible decisions with full evidence traceability

**Unlike** AI summary tools or traditional CRMs,

**We** connect every insight back to its source—so you can trust it, share it, and act on it.

### 4.2 Tagline Options

|---------|------------------------------|
| Alternative 1 | "Every insight shows its receipts." |

### 4.3 Key Differentiators

1. **Grounded, Not Generated** – Every insight links back to who said it, when, in what context
2. **One Place, Not Five Tools** – All synthesized together (calls, notes, tickets, surveys)
3. **Decisions, Not Decks** – Insights roll into tasks with owners and deadlines
4. **Human + AI, Not AI-Only** – AI assists; humans lead

### 4.4 What We Sell vs. What We Don't

| We Sell | We Don't Sell |
|---------|---------------|
| Defensible decisions | AI summaries |

## 6. Brand Personality & Voice

### 6.1 Brand Archetype

**The Guide / Sage** – A calm, experienced operator who's seen the mess and knows the way out. Not the hero of the story—that's the customer.

### 6.2 Personality Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Confident** | We know this works. No hedging. |

### 6.3 Voice Guidelines

**We say:**
- "Here's what customers are actually saying."

---

## 7. Key Messages

## 8. Campaign Concepts

### 8.1 Campaign: "Remember"

**Insight**: The tragedy isn't that teams don't listen—it's that they forget.

**Headline**: "Your customers told you everything. Do you remember?"

**Visual**: Split screen. Left: chaotic notes, scattered tools, arguing team. Right: calm, connected, decisive team.

**CTA**: "Start remembering"

### 8.2 Campaign: "Receipts"

**Insight**: AI tools promise summaries. We deliver proof.

**Headline**: "AI can say anything. We show the proof."

**Subhead**: Every AI tool gives you summaries. Only UpSight gives you receipts.

**Visual**: Bold insight statement with "show receipts" button revealing exact customer quote, timestamp, context.

**CTA**: "See the receipts"

### 8.3 Campaign: "One Truth"

**Insight**: Cross-functional alignment fails because teams have different versions of customer reality.

**Headline**: "Sales heard it. Product missed it. CS knew it. Nobody proved it. Until now."

**Visual**: Single thread connecting multiple people across company—all seeing the same customer insight.

**CTA**: "See one truth"

## 9. Proof Points & Social Proof

### 9.1 Time-to-Value Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Time to wow** | < 33 minutes (signup → cross-interview synthesis) |
| **First value** | Upload 2 conversations, see patterns immediately |
| **Full project value** | Same day (vs. 2+ weeks traditional synthesis) |

### 9.2 Success Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Second project usage** | > 60% = real adoption, not trial curiosity |
| **"Would you show this to your team?"** | Trust is the unlock |
| **Referral rate** | Teams who give a damn tell other teams |
| **Time saved (self-reported)** | ROI proof for expansion |

### 9.3 Case Study Framework

**Structure**:
1. **Before**: Chaos snapshot (hours spent, tools scattered, decisions questioned)
2. **Turning point**: First time they found an insight they would have missed
3. **After**: Quantified improvement (time saved, decisions accelerated)
4. **Quote**: One sentence on the emotional impact

---

## 10. Go-to-Market Guidance

### 10.1 Primary Call-to-Action

**"Start with one project and five conversations."**

**Why this works:**
- Low commitment (not "implement across your org")
- Concrete milestone (not "try it out")
- Fast time-to-wow (< 33 minutes)
- Natural expansion path (success leads to more projects)

### 10.2 Secondary CTAs

1. "Watch 2-minute demo"
2. "See how [similar company] uses UpSight"
3. "Talk to us"

### 10.3 Beachhead Strategy

**Phase 1: Solo Consultants**
- Buy alone, low CAC, fast feedback, become advocates

**Phase 2: Boutique Firms (5-15 people)**
- Word of mouth, team features, fast sales cycle

**Phase 3: Startup Product/UX Leads**
- No dedicated research team, need a system

**Phase 4: Practice Teams (15-50)**
- Only if pulled, don't chase prematurely

## 11. Brand Assessment

### What's Solid

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Core positioning** | Strong. "Customer truth, connected" is clear, differentiated, and memorable. |
| **Problem articulation** | Excellent. The "hearing problem" narrative is emotionally resonant and specific. |
| **Differentiation** | Clear. "Receipts" / evidence traceability is a genuine moat. |
| **Target audience** | Well-defined. Anti-personas add clarity. |
| **Voice & tone** | Consistent and distinctive. Anti-patterns prevent drift. |
| **Value proposition** | Concrete with quantified ROI. |
| **Campaign concepts** | Strong conceptual foundation with visual hooks. |

### Needs Work

| Element | Gap | Recommendation |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Social proof** | No customer testimonials, case studies, or logos yet | Prioritize collecting 3-5 early customer stories |
| **Pricing narrative** | Pricing undefined; value ≠ price articulation | Define pricing tiers with clear value mapping |
| **Visual identity** | No logo, color, typography guidelines in docs | Develop brand identity system |
| **Competitive proof** | Claims unsubstantiated with head-to-head comparisons | Create comparison landing pages with evidence |
| **Enterprise messaging** | Explicitly excluded but may need eventually | Park for now; revisit post-PMF |
| **Product screenshots** | No visual evidence of product in brand materials | Add product imagery to campaigns |
| **SEO/content strategy** | No documented content pillars | Define content themes aligned to positioning |
| **Partner/integration story** | Weak integration ecosystem acknowledged | Either build integrations or reframe as feature |
| **International considerations** | US-only language, no localization plan | Low priority but note for future |

### Critical Gaps to Address Before Launch

1. **Customer proof**: At minimum 3 testimonial quotes with names/companies
2. **Product visuals**: Screenshots showing the "receipts" experience
3. **Pricing page**: Even "contact us" with tier hints
4. **Competitive landing pages**: vs. Dovetail, vs. Gong, vs. Notion
5. **Demo video**: The 2-minute CTA needs actual content
