# UpSight Brand Brief

> **Document Purpose**: Canonical strategic foundation for all marketing, sales, product communications, and GTM execution. This is the single source of truth for positioning.
> **Version**: 3.1 | **Date**: February 14, 2026
> **Status**: Active

## Executive Summary

UpSight is a **Customer Intelligence Platform** that helps teams turn scattered customer conversations into decisions they can defend.

We don't sell transcription. We don't sell AI summaries. We sell the end of "I think the customer wants..." and the beginning of "Here's exactly what they said."

**Primary tagline**: Get your customers. Build conviction.

**Supporting message**: Build the right thing, faster.

**One-sentence positioning**: UpSight turns customer conversations into evidence-backed decisions — so teams stop debating and start shipping what customers actually need.

---

## 1. The Big Idea

### The Human Truth

**The best teams don't lack customer insight. They lose it.**

Every day, smart people at good companies talk to customers. They listen. They take notes. They learn things that could change everything.

And then it disappears.

Into a Notion doc nobody reads. A Zoom recording nobody watches. A Slack thread that scrolls away. Someone's head when they leave the company.

**The tragedy isn't that you don't listen. It's that listening isn't enough.**

Because what good is insight if you can't find it when it matters? What good is learning if you can't prove what you learned? What good is talking to customers if your team still argues about what customers actually want?

### The Pain (In Their Words)

> "I talked to 20 customers and can't prove what I learned."

That's the real problem. Not a lack of data. Not a lack of effort. A lack of *evidence* — searchable, shareable, traceable evidence that connects what customers said to what your team does about it.

### The Aspiration

**What if every decision your team makes could start with "Here's what customers actually said"?**

Not "I think." Not "My gut says." Not "The loudest person in the room believes."

Actual words. From actual customers. That anyone can find, verify, and act on.

That's not a feature. That's a different way of building a company.

### The Promise

**Get your customers. Build conviction.**

UpSight captures what customers tell you and turns it into decisions you can defend — so you stop debating and start shipping.

---

## 2. Brand Foundation

### 2.1 Why We Exist

To end the gap between what customers tell you and what your team does about it.

### 2.2 What We Believe

- **Customer conversations are gold.** But only if you can mine them.
- **AI should prove, not just produce.** Summaries without sources are just expensive guesses.
- **Speed matters.** The team that learns fastest wins.
- **Alignment beats brilliance.** A mediocre insight everyone acts on beats a great insight nobody sees.
- **Outcomes over features.** We don't sell tools. We sell confidence in what to build next.

### 2.3 What We Enable

| Old World | UpSight World |
|-----------|---------------|
| "I think customers want..." | "Here's exactly what they said." |
| Debate what to build | Decide what to build |
| Research dies in decks | Research drives roadmaps |
| Repeat the same discovery | Build on what you've learned |
| Loudest voice wins | Customer voice wins |
| 5 tools, zero integration | One platform, complete picture |
| Consultant spends days synthesizing | Consultant delivers same-day clarity |

---

## 3. Value Proposition

### 3.1 Core Value Prop

**Get your customers. Build conviction.**

UpSight turns every conversation — interviews, calls, surveys, support tickets — into searchable, shareable intelligence with evidence you can trace back to the source.

"Get your customers" works on two levels:
1. **Understand** your customers (intelligence)
2. **Win** your customers (outcome)

"Build conviction" is the universal outcome:
- Consultant builds conviction in their SOW and implementation plan
- Founder builds conviction in what to build next
- PM builds conviction to push back on the HiPPO
- CS leader builds conviction to prove churn risk to leadership

### 3.2 The Proof (Why Believe Us)

**Every insight shows its receipts.**

Click any theme, any finding, any recommendation — and see exactly who said it, when, in what context. This isn't AI hallucination. This is evidence you can verify.

> "AI can say anything. We show where it came from."

### 3.3 Value Ladder

```
OUTCOME (what you get)
├── Build the right thing → Ship what customers actually need
├── Move faster → Decisions in hours, not weeks of synthesis
├── Defend your decisions → Evidence, not opinions
└── Stop repeating work → Find what you've already learned

HOW (what UpSight does)
├── Captures every conversation → Interviews, calls, surveys, tickets, notes
├── Synthesizes what matters → Themes, patterns, insights, signals
├── Connects to action → Tasks, opportunities, roadmap items
└── Makes it findable → Search, chat, share

WHY TRUST IT (the differentiator)
└── Every insight links to source → Click to verify. See the receipts.
```

### 3.4 Three Promises

| Promise | Meaning | Proof |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Build the right thing** | Stop guessing what customers want | Evidence-backed prioritization |
| **Move faster** | Decisions in hours, not weeks | Same-day synthesis vs. 2+ weeks manual |
| **Defend your decisions** | End "he said, she said" debates | Click any insight, see the source |

## 4. Category

### 4.1 Category Definition

**Customer Intelligence Platform**

Not a CRM. Not a research repository. Not a call recorder.

A platform that turns customer conversations into intelligence you can trust and act on.

### 4.2 Why Not CRM

CRM has specific associations (pipeline management, deal tracking, activity logging) that position UpSight against Salesforce, HubSpot, Clarify, and Nutshell — where we lose on integrations, ecosystem maturity, and pricing. CRM features exist in the product (contact management, organization tracking), but they are not the value proposition. CRM is a **feature**, not our **category**.

### 4.3 YC Validation: "Cursor for Product Managers"

Y Combinator's Spring 2026 Request for Startups lists **"Cursor for Product Managers"** as the #1 opportunity. Their framing:

> "Cursor and Claude Code are great at helping teams build software once it's clear what needs to be built. But writing code is only part of building a product people want. **The most important part is figuring out what to build in the first place.**"

YC's vision: upload customer interviews and product usage data → ask "what should we build next?" → get evidence-backed feature outlines → task breakdown for coding agents.

**This is UpSight's pipeline.** Customer voice → evidence with receipts → themes & insights → action items.

**Why this matters for positioning:**

| YC's Thesis | UpSight's Reality |
|-------------|-------------------|
| AI forced the bottleneck upstream — from coding to deciding *what* to build | Our entire value prop is "build the right thing" |
| Upload customer interviews, ask what to build | Our upload → synthesis → insight flow |
| Evidence-backed recommendations | "Every insight shows its receipts" |
| No comprehensive solution exists | Point solutions cover pieces; nobody connects voice → evidence → decision → action |

**Where emerging competitors fall short:**

| Competitor | What They Do | What's Missing |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mimir** (HN Feb 2026) | "Cursor for PMs" — PRD generation | No customer voice input. Starts *after* you already think you know what to build. |
| **ChatPRD** | AI PRD generation, roadmap planning | Same gap — helps you write the PRD, not figure out if it's worth writing. |
| **Dart** (YC W22) | "Cursor for Project Management" | Task management, not product discovery. Different problem. |
| **VoicePanel** (YC W24) | Automated customer research | Research input only — no synthesis → decision → action pipeline. |
| **BuildBetter** | AI customer feedback analysis | Feedback analysis only. No end-to-end discovery workflow. |

**Our unique position**: We're the only tool that starts from *real customer voice* and connects it all the way through to defensible decisions. ChatPRD helps you write the PRD. We help you figure out if the PRD is worth writing.

### 4.4 Category Positioning

## 5. Target Audience

### 5.1 Who This Is For

**Teams small enough to care, busy enough to need help.**

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Company Size** | 1-50 people |
| **Customer Contact** | Weekly conversations (not quarterly research projects) |
| **Pain Level** | Losing insights across tools and people |
| **Decision Style** | Want to be evidence-driven but lack infrastructure |
| **Budget Reality** | Can't afford Dovetail + Gong + dedicated researcher |
| **Common Thread** | They talk to customers. They want it to matter. |

### 5.2 Primary Personas

#### The Consultant / Fractional Exec (Beachhead)
- **Reality**: Drowning in stakeholder interviews, synthesizing for days before they can deliver clarity
- **Fear**: Recommendations that get challenged or ignored. SOWs built on gut feeling.
- **Dream**: Walk into every meeting with undeniable evidence. Deliver implementation plans grounded in what stakeholders actually said.
- **Outcome**: Build conviction in their SOW and implementation plan
- **Message**: "From stakeholder interviews to undeniable recommendations."
- **Onboarding hook**: Real-time meeting recorder captures their next client call, delivers synthesis same day
- **ROI**: 8-12 hours saved per project at $150-300/hr = $1,200-3,600/project

#### The Founder (5-30 person company)
- **Reality**: Talks to customers constantly, insights trapped in their head
- **Fear**: Building the wrong thing. Again.
- **Dream**: Make decisions their team trusts and customers validate
- **Outcome**: Build conviction in what to ship next
- **Message**: "Stop debating what to build. Know."

#### The Post-Launch Founder (Weak Traction)
- **Reality**: Shipped something, growth stalled, needs to figure out why fast
- **Fear**: Running out of runway building the wrong thing
- **Dream**: Find the signal in customer conversations that unlocks growth
- **Outcome**: Build conviction in the pivot-or-persevere decision
- **Message**: "Find what customers are trying to tell you."
- **Why important**: Highest urgency, highest willingness to pay, most desperate for clarity

#### The Product Lead (no research team)
- **Reality**: Owns customer insight but lacks time and tools
- **Fear**: Research that dies in a slide deck
- **Dream**: Evidence that actually changes what gets built
- **Outcome**: Build conviction in the roadmap
- **Message**: "Research that ships."

### 5.3 Deprioritized Personas

#### The CS Leader
- **Kept in product** but not primary marketing focus
- **Reality**: Hears churn signals, can't prove them to leadership
- **Message**: "See it coming. Prove it. Fix it."

#### Sales Teams
- **Not targeted in current positioning.** Sales features (BANT lens, opportunity tracking) exist in the product but are not part of GTM messaging. Targeting sales teams invites competitive comparison with Gong ($300M+ ARR, 250+ integrations) and Clarify/Nutshell where we lose.
- **Revisit when**: We have 50+ active customers and proven product-market fit with primary personas.

### 5.4 Who This Isn't For

- Companies that don't talk to customers
- Enterprises with 47 tools they'll never consolidate
- Anyone looking for AI magic without doing the work
- Teams with dedicated research ops (8+ people)
- Sales-only orgs who just want call coaching
- Zero-to-one founders who haven't shipped anything yet (low willingness to pay, high churn)

## 6. Competitive Positioning

### 6.1 Competitive Framing

| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "AI-powered summaries" | "Evidence you can verify" |
| "Research repository" | "Decision engine" |
| "Capture everything" | "Find what matters" |
| "Insights" | "Proof" |

### 6.2 Head-to-Head

| Competitor | Their Game | Our Angle | Threat Level |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **VoicePanel** | AI-only voice research (YC W24) | Human+AI hybrid, richer output (lenses, themes, evidence trails, not just summaries), multi-source input beyond interviews | **Highest** |
| **Dovetail** | Research repository for UX teams ($700M valuation) | For teams *without* dedicated researchers. Simpler, faster, voice-first. | **High** |
| **Gong** | Sales call coaching ($300M+ ARR) | For the whole company, not just sales. Evidence for decisions, not coaching. | **High** (different market) |
| **Looppanel** | Interview analysis ($27/mo) | End-to-end: capture, synthesize, connect to action. Not just analysis. | **Medium** |
| **Clarify** | AI-native CRM (free + credits) | Depth of research analysis. Not a CRM competitor. | **Medium** |
| **Mimir** | "Cursor for PMs" — PRD generation | Starts after you decide. We start from customer voice. No evidence traceability. | **Low** (early) |
| **ChatPRD** | AI PRD generation + roadmap planning | Same gap — no customer voice input. Helps write the PRD, not decide if it's worth writing. | **Low** |
| **Dart** (YC W22) | "Cursor for Project Management" | Project management, not product discovery. Different problem entirely. | **Low** |
| **Notion + AI** | Docs with AI bolted on | Purpose-built for customer evidence. Not a general-purpose tool. | **Low** |

### 6.3 VoicePanel (Key Competitor Deep Dive)

**Why they're dangerous:**
- Same space (AI voice research)
- YC W24 + strong angels (Dropbox, Instacart founders)
- Already shipped AI-only interviewer
- If they add human modes, our differentiation shrinks

**Our actual advantages over VoicePanel:**
1. **Human+AI hybrid** — their AI-only approach can't handle sensitive stakeholder conversations where human judgment matters
2. **Multi-source input** — they do interviews only. We capture calls, surveys, tickets, notes, transcripts, PDFs
3. **Evidence traceability** — our "receipts" system (click any insight, see the source) vs. their summary-first approach
4. **Research lenses** — structured analysis frameworks, not generic tagging
5. **Action connection** — insights connect to tasks and outcomes, not just a report

**Their advantage over us:**
- They've shipped the AI interviewer. We need to ship the hybrid experience.

### 6.4 Our Moat

**Hard to copy:**
- **Evidence graph**: The connection layer between insight and source across all conversation types
- **Multi-source synthesis**: Unified model across calls, surveys, tickets, notes, transcripts
- **Research lenses**: Structured frameworks for analysis (not generic tagging)
- **Trust through transparency**: The "show receipts" paradigm

**Easy to copy (not our moat):**
- Transcription (commodity)
- AI summaries (everyone has GPT)
- Pretty dashboards (design is tablestakes)

## 7. Messaging Framework

### 7.1 Tagline Hierarchy

| Level | Message | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Primary** | "Get your customers. Build conviction." | Homepage hero, brand campaigns, first impression |
| **Supporting** | "Build the right thing, faster." | Product pages, feature context, action-oriented moments |
| **Proof** | "Every insight shows its receipts." | Differentiation, competitive positioning, trust |

### 7.2 The "Upstream Bottleneck" Narrative

Use in investor conversations, thought leadership, and category definition content:

> AI made building software trivially fast. But building the *right* software? That's the bottleneck now. The teams that win aren't the ones who ship fastest — they're the ones who know what's worth shipping. That requires evidence, not opinions. UpSight is how you get it.

**Key talking points:**
- "Code is cheap now. Conviction is expensive." — AI coding tools solved execution. The constraint moved upstream to discovery and decision-making.
- "YC's #1 startup idea for 2026 is literally what we built." — External validation for the category.
- "Everyone's building AI tools for *after* you decide what to build. We help you make the decision." — Positions against ChatPRD, Cursor, Dart, and AI coding tools.

## 8. Brand Voice

### 8.1 Brand Archetype

**The Trusted Operator**

Not the flashy visionary. Not the aggressive disruptor. The calm, experienced builder who's seen teams waste months building the wrong thing — and knows there's a better way.

We're the person you want in the room when decisions get hard.

### 8.2 Voice Principles

| Principle | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Direct** | Say it plainly. No jargon. | "See what customers said" not "Leverage voice-of-customer insights" |
| **Confident** | We've seen this work. No hedging. | "You'll find patterns in minutes" not "You might potentially discover..." |
| **Grounded** | AI hype is everywhere. We're not. | "Every insight shows its source" not "Revolutionary AI-powered intelligence" |
| **Useful** | Help, don't lecture. | "Here's how to get started" not "Best practices for customer centricity" |
| **Outcome-first** | Lead with what changes, not what we built. | "Defend your next decision" not "Multi-source evidence aggregation" |

### 8.3 We Say / We Don't Say

| We Say | We Don't Say |
|--------|--------------|
| "Here's what customers said" | "AI-powered insights" |
| "See the source" | "Unlock the power of" |
| "Build the right thing" | "10x your customer understanding" |
| "Find patterns in minutes" | "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" |
| "Proof you can point to" | "Actionable intelligence" |
| "Get your customers" | "Leverage voice-of-customer" |
| "Build conviction" | "Drive alignment" |

### 8.4 Tone by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| **Homepage** | Confident, slightly provocative |
| **Product UI** | Clear, helpful, encouraging |
| **Errors** | Honest, specific, fixable |
| **Success moments** | Warm but not performative |
| **Sales** | Consultative, curious, not pushy |
| **Consultant-facing** | Peer-to-peer, practical, ROI-focused |

## 9. Campaigns

### 9.1 Campaign: "Build Conviction"

**Insight**: Every persona needs to build conviction — in their SOW, their roadmap, their pivot decision, their recommendations.

**Headline**: "Get your customers. Build conviction."

**Visual**: Persona card approach (THINKS / FEELS / USES) — empathy mapping on the homepage. Shows we practice what we preach.

**Tagline**: "Customer Intelligence Platform"

**CTA**: "Start seeing your customers"

---

### 9.2 Campaign: "Receipts"

**Insight**: AI tools make claims. We show proof.

**Headline**: "AI can say anything. We show where it came from."

**Visual**: Bold insight statement. "Show source" button. Click reveals exact quote, speaker, timestamp, context.

**Subhead**: "Every insight. Verified. Traceable. Defensible."

**CTA**: "See it in action"

---

### 9.3 Campaign: "The Last Time"

**Insight**: Teams repeat the same customer discovery because nobody can find what was already learned.

**Concept**: A series showing "the last time" moments:
- "The last time you'll wonder what customers actually said."
- "The last time you'll dig through Notion for that one quote."
- "The last time you'll argue about priorities without proof."
- "The last time you'll build something nobody asked for."
- "The last time you'll spend 3 days synthesizing interviews."

**Visual**: Stark, clean. Problem on left (chaos), solution on right (clarity).

**CTA**: "Make it the last time"

---

### 9.4 Campaign: "Remember" (from Manifesto)

**Insight**: The best companies don't just talk to customers. They remember.

**Copy**:
> Here's to the teams who actually talk to their customers.
> The ones who pick up the phone. Who sit in the room. Who listen.
> But here's the tragedy: They listen. They learn. Then they lose it.
> Notes in Notion. Recordings in Zoom. Insights in someone's head.
> By the time it matters, nobody can find what they heard.

**Tagline**: "Get your customers. Build conviction."

**Use**: Long-form content, brand video, manifesto page.

---

### 9.5 Campaign: "One Conversation Away"

**Insight**: The insight that changes everything might already be in a recording you haven't watched.

**Headline**: "The answer's in a conversation you've already had."

**Visual**: Mountain of video files, transcripts, notes. One golden thread running through them.

**Subhead**: "UpSight finds what matters in what you've already captured."

**CTA**: "Upload your first conversation"

---

## 10. Proof Points

## 11. Go-to-Market

### 11.1 Primary CTAs

| Context | CTA | Why |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Homepage** | "Start seeing your customers" | Outcome-focused, curiosity-driven |
| **Consultant landing** | "Record your next client meeting" | Practical, zero-effort onboarding |
| **Founder landing** | "Start with 5 conversations" | Low commitment, concrete milestone |
| **Upload flow** | "Upload your first conversation" | Action for users with existing recordings |
| **Demo** | "Get a Demo" | For people who want to be shown |

### 11.2 Beachhead Sequence

| Phase | Segment | Why First | Entry Point |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | Solo consultants | Buy alone, fastest feedback loop, clearest ROI math, become advocates | Real-time meeting recorder on next client call |
| **2** | Post-launch founders (weak traction) | Highest urgency, willing to pay, need clarity fast | Upload existing customer conversations |
| **3** | Startup product leads (no research team) | Need the infrastructure, natural product champions | Smart survey or first project |
| **4** | Boutique consulting firms (5-15) | Word of mouth from Phase 1, team features | Consultant referral |
| **5** | Growth teams (15-50) | Only if pulled, don't chase | Organic expansion |

### 11.3 Channel Strategy

| Channel | Use For | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **LinkedIn (organic)** | Thought leadership, consultant reach, "listen learn lose" narrative | High |
| **Product Hunt** | Launch moment, early adopter signal | High (one-time) |
| **Consulting communities** | Fractional exec networks, consulting Slacks | High |
| **Communities** | Lenny's, Product Coalition, Indie Hackers | Medium |
| **Content/SEO** | "How to synthesize customer interviews", "stakeholder interview to SOW" | Medium |
| **Partnerships** | Fractional exec networks, consulting tools | Medium |

### 11.4 Pricing Direction

> **Status**: Not yet defined. Critical gap.

| Consideration | Direction |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Model** | Usage-based or project-based (not pure per-seat; consultants hate per-seat) |
| **Free tier** | Limited conversations/month to prove value, not full product |
| **Paid entry** | ~$49-99/month range (competitive with Looppanel $27/mo, above Fathom $19/mo) |
| **Value anchor** | Consultant ROI: $99/mo vs. $1,200-3,600/project saved |
| **Constraint** | Processing and storage costs are real (bootstrapped). Can't afford to lose money on free tier. |

**Next step**: Define specific tiers with conversation limits and feature gates.

---

## 12. Positioning Statement (Formal)

**For** teams who talk to customers constantly but lose what they learn,

**UpSight** is the customer intelligence platform

**That** turns conversations into decisions you can defend

**Unlike** AI summary tools that generate unverifiable text,

**UpSight** connects every insight to its source — so you can trust it, share it, and ship it.

---

## 13. Assessment & Open Items

### What's Strong

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Core promise** | "Get your customers. Build conviction." is clear, emotional, universal |
| **Problem narrative** | "Listen, learn, lose it" is emotionally true and differentiated |
| **Differentiator** | Evidence traceability ("receipts") is real, hard to copy, and matters |
| **Target definition** | Tight ICP with clear beachhead sequence and anti-personas |
| **Voice** | Confident without being arrogant, outcome-first without being vague |
| **Homepage execution** | Hero + persona cards validate the positioning visually |

### What Needs Work

| Gap | Priority | Action |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Customer proof** | Critical | Get 3-5 testimonials with names before launch |
| **Pricing** | Critical | Define tiers with clear value mapping |
| **Product visuals** | Critical | Screenshots showing the "see source" experience |
| **VoicePanel response** | High | Competitive page: UpSight vs. VoicePanel |
| **Demo video** | High | 2-minute video for CTAs |
| **Consultant landing page** | High | Dedicated page with SOW/implementation plan angle |
| **Competitive pages** | Medium | vs. Dovetail, vs. Gong, vs. Notion landing pages |
| **Content strategy** | Medium | Define SEO pillars aligned to positioning |

### Decisions Made (Closed)

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| CRM or not? | **Not CRM.** Customer Intelligence Platform. | CRM invites wrong competitive frame (Salesforce, HubSpot, Clarify). CRM is a feature, not our category. |
| Primary tagline? | **"Get your customers. Build conviction."** | Outcome-focused, works across all personas, validated by homepage execution |
| Beachhead? | **Consultants first**, founders fast-follow | Clearest ROI math, fastest close, buy alone, become advocates |
| Sales teams? | **Deprioritized.** Not in GTM messaging. | No convincing case for early focus. Features exist but don't drive positioning. |
| "Build the right thing" vs. "Make better decisions"? | **"Build the right thing"** as supporting message | More concrete, more actionable, applies to consultants (build the right SOW) and PMs alike |
| AI skepticism angle? | **Yes, lean in.** "AI can say anything. We show where it came from." | Timely, differentiated, grounded. Matches "Trusted Operator" archetype. |
| YC "Cursor for PMs" alignment? | **Yes, lean in.** Use for investor narrative and category validation. | YC's #1 RFS describes our pipeline. We're the only tool that starts from customer voice and connects to action. Emerging competitors (Mimir, ChatPRD) start *after* the decision is already made. |

### Open Questions (Remaining)

1. **Pricing tiers** — what are the specific numbers and feature gates?
2. **VoicePanel competitive positioning** — detailed head-to-head page
3. **Post-launch founder messaging** — needs user research validation
4. **Integration story** — how to address "works with your existing tools" when integrations are limited

### Archived Documents

Moved to `./archive/`. Informed this brief but are no longer canonical.

| Document | Why Archived |
|----------|-------------|
| `positioning-brief-v2.md` | Best copy extracted into campaigns (Section 9). CRM framing and "Make work work" tagline retired. |
| `customer-centric-crm-value-prop.md` | Feature breakdown — useful for product team, not positioning. |
| `user-value-prop.md` | Reclassified as product/onboarding spec. |

### Reference Documents (Not Archived, Still Useful)

|----------|--------|-------|

| `market/positioning-consulting/consulting-practices-assessment.md` | **Beachhead reference** | Market opportunity detail for consulting ICP. |

| `market/competitors-discovery-sales-notes/our-honest-assessment.md` | **Active internal doc** | Reality check. Update regularly. Most honest document in the set. |
