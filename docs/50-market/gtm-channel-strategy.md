## Channel Priority Ranking

| Rank | Channel | Type | Monthly Budget | Founder Time | Phase |
|------|---------|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **LinkedIn Organic** | Owned | $0 | 10+ hrs/wk | Start immediately |
| 2 | **Direct Outreach & Demos** | Owned | $0 | 8-10 hrs/wk | Start immediately |
| 3 | **LinkedIn Ads** | Paid | $1,000-2,000 | 2-3 hrs/wk | Month 1 |
| 4 | **Product Hunt** | Earned | $0 | 10 hrs/wk (prep) | Month 2-3 (launch) |
| 5 | **Podcast Guesting** | Earned | $0 | 2 hrs/wk | Month 1 |
| 6 | **Reddit Organic** | Owned | $0 | 3-5 hrs/wk | Month 1 |
| 7 | **Newsletter Sponsorships** | Paid | $500-1,000 | 1 hr/wk | Month 2 |
| 8 | **Google Search Ads** | Paid | $500-1,000 | 2 hrs/wk | Month 2 |
| 9 | **X / Twitter Organic** | Owned | $0 | 2-3 hrs/wk | Month 1 |
| 10 | **Email Nurture** | Owned | $0 (Brevo free tier) | 2 hrs/wk | Month 1 |
| 11 | **YouTube** | Owned | $500 (production) | 5 hrs/mo | Month 3 |
| — | **TikTok** | — | Skip | — | — |

**Ranking rationale:** At pre-PMF with a small budget, founder credibility and direct relationships beat paid acquisition. LinkedIn organic + direct outreach are free and high-conversion. Paid channels (LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads, newsletter sponsorships) are for testing and learning which messages convert, not for scale yet.

---

## 1. LinkedIn Organic (Founder-Led)

### Why This Channel

LinkedIn is the single highest-ROI channel for a B2B SaaS founder pre-PMF. The founder's personal account will get 5-10x the reach of a company page. Every PM, consultant, and UX researcher you're targeting lives here.

### Target Audience

- Product Managers at 10-200 person companies
- Solo consultants and fractional executives
- UX researchers and research leads
- Early-stage founders doing customer discovery

### Tactics & Content Formats

**Weekly cadence:**

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Monday | Insight/observation | "Most teams run 20+ interviews a quarter. They use 3% of what they learn." |
| Tuesday | Engage-only (no post) | Comment on 10-15 posts from target personas |
| Wednesday | Carousel or framework | "5 signs your customer evidence has a shelf life problem" (PDF carousel) |
| Thursday | Behind-the-scenes | "What I learned building UpSight this week" |
| Friday | Question or poll | "How do you organize insights from customer interviews?" |

**Format effectiveness ranking:**
1. Text-only posts with line breaks (highest organic reach)
2. Carousel/PDF documents (high dwell time, algorithmic boost)
3. Short native video 60-90s (underused in B2B = bonus reach)
4. Polls (easy engagement but lower quality)
5. Posts with external links (lowest — LinkedIn suppresses outbound)

**Content themes:**
- Customer evidence gaps ("Your customer research has a trust problem")
- Research synthesis pain ("20 interviews. 3 weeks of synthesis. 1 slide deck that gets ignored.")
- Consultant productivity ("The 8 hours between the interview and the recommendation is where consultants lose margin")
- Evidence vs. opinion ("'We heard from customers that...' — the most dangerous sentence in product")
- Build-in-public updates (authentic, shows traction)

### Budget

$0. This is 100% founder time investment.

### KPIs

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Impressions/week | 2K-5K | 10K-25K | 25K-50K |
| Profile views/week | 50-100 | 200-500 | 500-1K |
| Connection requests received/week | 10-20 | 30-50 | 50-100 |
| Inbound DMs/week | 1-3 | 5-10 | 10-20 |
| Website clicks/week | 5-15 | 20-50 | 50-100 |

### Timeline

- **Week 1:** Optimize profile (headline = value prop, banner = UpSight, featured section = demo link)
- **Weeks 1-4:** Post 4-5x/week, build commenting habit
- **Month 2+:** Refine based on what gets engagement. Double down on top-performing formats.

### Kill Criteria

Don't kill this channel — it's free and compounds. If engagement is flat after 8 weeks, audit content quality, posting times, and engagement reciprocity (you need to comment on others' posts, not just broadcast).

---

## 2. Direct Outreach & Demos

### Why This Channel

At pre-PMF, nothing beats a live conversation. Direct outreach to your existing network (SoCal, cybersecurity, consulting contacts) has the highest conversion rate of any channel. These are warm leads who already trust you.

### Target Audience

- **Tier 1 (warmest):** Existing LinkedIn connections in consulting, cybersecurity, or startup roles
- **Tier 2:** Second-degree connections via warm intros
- **Tier 3:** Cold outreach to consultants on LinkedIn who post about customer research

### Tactics

**Phase 1: Network Activation (Weeks 1-4)**

1. Export LinkedIn connections, tag by persona (consultant, founder, PM, cybersecurity)
2. Identify top 50 outreach targets
3. Send 10-20 personalized messages per week

**Outreach templates:**

*Warm (existing connection):*
> "Hey [Name], I've been building something I'd love your take on. We're turning customer conversations into evidence-backed decisions — think of it as a way to stop losing insights from stakeholder interviews. Would you have 20 minutes for a demo? Happy to show you how it works and get your honest feedback."

*Warm intro request:*
> "Hey [Mutual], I see you're connected to [Target] — they're doing exactly the kind of consulting work that UpSight was built for. Would you be open to making an intro? Happy to send you a blurb to forward."

*Cold (consultant who posts about research):*
> "Hey [Name], saw your post about [specific topic]. We built UpSight to solve exactly that — turning stakeholder interviews into structured evidence without the 2-week synthesis grind. Would love to show you a 15-min demo if you're curious."

**Phase 2: Demo-to-Conversion**

- Run 3-5 demos per week
- Use the "research frame": demos are learning conversations, not sales pitches
- After demo: offer guided onboarding (help them upload their first interviews)
- Follow up within 48 hours with a summary of what the tool found in their data

### Budget

$0. Pure time investment.

### KPIs

| Metric | Weekly Target |
|--------|--------------|
| Outreach messages sent | 10-20 |
| Response rate | 15-25% |
| Demos booked | 3-5 |
| Demo → trial conversion | 50-70% |
| Trial → paid conversion | 25%+ |

### Kill Criteria

If response rate drops below 5% for 3 consecutive weeks, reassess messaging and targeting. Switch personas or try different angles before stopping.

---

## 3. LinkedIn Ads

### Why This Channel

LinkedIn's targeting is unmatched for B2B — you can target by exact job title, company size, skills, and industry. At $1-2K/month you can run meaningful tests. The goal is learning, not scale: which persona converts, which message resonates, which CTA works.

### Target Audience

**Campaign 1: Product Managers**
- Job titles: Product Manager, Senior PM, Director of Product, VP Product
- Company size: 11-200 employees
- Skills: Customer Discovery, User Research, Product Strategy, Jobs-to-Be-Done
- Industries: Technology, SaaS, Internet

**Campaign 2: Consultants**
- Job titles: Management Consultant, Strategy Consultant, Fractional CXO, Principal
- Company size: 1-50 employees (self-employed + boutique firms)
- Skills: Stakeholder Management, Business Strategy, Advisory
- Industries: Management Consulting, Business Consulting

**Campaign 3: UX Researchers (Month 2+)**
- Job titles: UX Researcher, User Researcher, Research Lead, Design Researcher
- Company size: 11-500 employees
- Skills: Qualitative Research, User Interviews, Usability Testing

### Ad Formats to Test

1. **Single Image Sponsored Content** → Lead magnet or signup page
2. **Document Ads (Carousel)** → Educational content that ends with CTA
3. **Video Ads (30-60s)** → Quick product demo

### Expected Costs (2025-2026 B2B SaaS Benchmarks)

| Metric | LinkedIn Average | Our Target |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| CPC (Sponsored Content) | $5-12 | <$10 |
| CPM | $30-60 | $35-50 |
| CTR (Sponsored Content) | 0.4-0.65% | >0.5% |
| CTR (Document Ads) | 0.4-0.6% | >0.5% |
| CTR (Video Ads) | 0.3-0.5% | >0.4% |
| CPL (to trial signup) | $80-250 | <$150 |
| Cost per demo request | $150-500 | <$300 |

### Sample Ad Copy

**Ad 1 — PM Pain (Single Image)**
- Headline: "Your Customers Said It. Can You Prove It?"
- Body: "Product decisions are only as good as the evidence behind them. UpSight turns customer conversations into searchable evidence — so when leadership asks 'how do we know?', you have the receipts."
- CTA: "Try Free"

**Ad 2 — Consultant ROI (Single Image)**
- Headline: "From Stakeholder Interviews to Recommendations in Hours"
- Body: "Stop spending 2 weeks synthesizing interview notes. UpSight analyzes stakeholder conversations and extracts evidence, themes, and patterns — so you can deliver defensible recommendations faster."
- CTA: "See How It Works"

**Ad 3 — Research Pain (Document Ad / Carousel)**
- Slide 1: "You ran 20 interviews last quarter."
- Slide 2: "Your team used insights from 3 of them."
- Slide 3: "The rest? Lost in docs, decks, and people's heads."
- Slide 4: "UpSight turns every conversation into evidence you can search, share, and act on."
- Slide 5: "Start free → getupsight.com"

**Ad 4 — Social Proof / Build-in-Public (Video)**
- 45-second screen recording showing: upload interview → AI extracts evidence → browse themes → link to decision
- Text overlay: "From customer call to evidence library in 5 minutes"
- CTA: "Try It Free"

**Ad 5 — Competitor Positioning**
- Headline: "Research That Doesn't Die in a Slide Deck"
- Body: "Unlike generic note-taking tools, UpSight gives you evidence with attribution — every insight traceable to a real conversation. Built for teams who act on what customers say."
- CTA: "Start Free Trial"

### Budget Allocation

| Phase | Monthly Spend | Split |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Month 1-3 | $1,000-2,000 | 50% PM campaign, 50% Consultant campaign |
| Month 4-6 | $2,000-3,000 | Scale winner + add retargeting |

### A/B Testing Roadmap

| Month | Test | Variable |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | Persona test | PM targeting vs. Consultant targeting (same ad) |
| 1 | Message test | Evidence angle vs. time-saving angle |
| 2 | Format test | Single image vs. document ad vs. video |
| 2 | CTA test | "Try Free" vs. "See Demo" vs. "Learn More" |
| 3 | Audience test | Skills-based vs. job-title-based targeting |
| 3 | Landing page test | Generic vs. persona-specific landing page |

### Timeline

- **Month 1:** Launch 2 campaigns (PM + Consultant), 2 ads each. Budget: $1K-2K.
- **Month 2:** Pause losers, scale winners. Add UX researcher campaign. Test document ads.
- **Month 3:** Add retargeting (website visitors + video viewers). Optimize CPL.

### Kill Criteria

- **Pause a campaign** if CPL > $300 after $500 spent
- **Pause the channel** if no campaign achieves CPL < $200 after 60 days and $3K total spend
- **Scale** if any campaign hits CPL < $100

---

## 4. Product Hunt

### Why This Channel

Product Hunt delivers a concentrated burst of early-adopter traffic. A well-executed launch can generate 2K-20K visitors and 100-1,500 signups in 48 hours. The long tail (Product Hunt SEO, "best of" lists) continues driving traffic for months.

### Target Audience

Early adopters, indie hackers, startup founders, product people who browse PH daily.

### Tactics

**Pre-Launch (4-6 weeks before):**
1. Create "Coming Soon" page on Product Hunt
2. Engage daily: upvote and comment on 3-5 other launches
3. Recruit a hunter with 1,000+ PH followers who has launched B2B/productivity tools
4. Build supporter email list (target 100-300 committed people)
5. Brief your LinkedIn/X network to support launch day
6. Prepare all assets:
   - Tagline (under 60 chars): "Turn customer conversations into evidence your team trusts"
   - 4-6 high-quality product screenshots
   - 60-90s product video (screen recording with narration)
   - First comment: maker story (authentic, tell the why — not a feature list)
   - Exclusive PH offer: extended trial or founding member pricing ($49/mo lifetime)

**Launch Day Execution:**
- Launch at 12:01 AM PT (PH resets at midnight Pacific)
- Post maker comment immediately
- Respond to every comment within 30 minutes
- Share direct PH link across all channels (LinkedIn, X, email, Slack communities)
- Founder and any team members engaged throughout the day
- Post a LinkedIn update at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM PT with progress

**Post-Launch (Week after):**
- Follow up personally with every commenter
- Convert PH traffic → email list → trials with targeted drip sequence
- Write a "lessons from our Product Hunt launch" blog post (good for SEO + community)
- Submit to Product Hunt collections and "alternatives to" pages

### Expected Results

| Outcome | Upvotes | Visitors | Signups |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| Top 5 of the day | 300-1,000 | 2K-10K | 100-500 |
| Top 1-3 of the day | 500-2,000 | 5K-20K | 300-1,500 |
| Product of the Day | 1,000+ | 10K-30K | 500+ (significant press) |

### Budget

$0 direct cost. ~40 hours of founder prep time over 4-6 weeks.

### KPIs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Upvotes (day 1) | 300+ |
| Comments | 50+ |
| Website visitors (launch week) | 3K+ |
| Email signups | 200+ |
| Trial signups | 50-150 |
| Trial → paid (30 days post-launch) | 10-25% |

### Timeline

- **Months 1-2:** Prep (build community, engage on PH, prepare assets)
- **Month 2-3:** Launch on optimal Tuesday-Thursday

### Kill Criteria

N/A — this is a one-time event. Success is measured by the numbers above.

## 5. Podcast Guesting

### Why This Channel

Guest appearances on niche B2B podcasts build credibility, create evergreen content (episodes get discovered for years), and reach audiences that don't live on LinkedIn. It's free — you invest time pitching and recording.

### Target Audience

PM, UX, founder, and consulting audiences who consume podcasts.

### Tactics

1. **Identify 15-20 target podcasts** (see [gtm-conferences-communities.md](./gtm-conferences-communities.md) for full list)
2. Pitch 3-5 podcasts per week via email or LinkedIn DM to the host
3. Lead with a topic angle, not a product pitch

**Pitch template:**
> Subject: Guest pitch: Why customer evidence beats customer research
>
> Hi [Host],
>
> I'm [Name], founder of UpSight. I've been thinking a lot about why teams do customer research but rarely use it — and I have a framework for closing that gap.
>
> Topic angle: "The Evidence Gap — why most customer research dies in slide decks and what to do about it"
>
> I can cover: why AI summaries aren't enough, the difference between insights and evidence, and a practical system for making research stick.
>
> Would this be a fit for [Podcast Name]?

**Topic angles to pitch:**
1. "The Evidence Gap" — why customer research dies in slide decks
2. "Human + AI hybrid research" — what AI gets right and wrong about customer interviews
3. "Customer discovery for consultants" — the synthesis bottleneck that eats margins
4. "Building conviction" — how evidence-backed product decisions reduce organizational friction
5. "Voice-first research" — why typing kills discovery quality

### Budget

$0.

### KPIs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Pitches sent per month | 12-20 |
| Appearances booked per quarter | 3-5 |
| Referral traffic per episode | 20-50 visitors |
| Trial signups per episode | 2-5 |

### Timeline

- **Month 1:** Begin pitching. Aim for first recording by end of month.
- **Month 2-3:** First episodes air. 1-2 appearances per month.
- **Ongoing:** Maintain 1-2 per month as a steady channel.

### Kill Criteria

If zero podcasts respond after 30 pitches, revise the topic angle and pitch. Don't stop — refine.

---

## 6. Reddit Organic

### Why This Channel

Reddit has active communities of PMs, UX researchers, and founders who ask genuine questions about customer research. Answering those questions builds trust over time. Reddit organic is slow but compounds — a great answer can drive traffic for years via search.

### Target Audience

- r/productmanagement (120K+) — PMs asking about research, discovery, tools
- r/userexperience (200K+) — UX practitioners discussing research methods
- r/UXResearch — dedicated UX research community
- r/startups (1M+) — founders asking about customer validation
- r/SaaS (100K+) — SaaS founders sharing tools and journeys
- r/Entrepreneur — broader audience, good for build-in-public

### Tactics

**Phase 1: Build Reputation (Weeks 1-8)**
- Create account (or use existing personal account — NOT a brand account)
- Answer 3-5 questions per week in target subreddits
- Share frameworks, personal experience, and genuine advice
- Never mention UpSight. Build karma and history first.
- Upvote and engage with others' posts

**Phase 2: Soft Mentions (Weeks 8-12)**
- When someone asks "what tools do you use for X?", mention UpSight alongside other tools naturally
- Post value-first content: "Here's how I synthesize customer interviews" (with UpSight screenshots as natural examples)

**Phase 3: Build-in-Public (Month 3+)**
- Post "I built this" in r/SaaS with transparent journey story
- Share honest metrics, lessons learned, challenges
- Cross-post to r/startups if relevant

### Sample Answers

*Q: "How do you organize insights from customer interviews?"*
> "I've tried Notion, Dovetail, and a few others. The biggest problem wasn't the tool — it was that insights had no context. Someone would tag a 'pain point' but there was no way to trace it back to who said it or when. I started looking for tools that keep the evidence attached to the insight. There are a few newer ones doing this well."

*Q: "How do consultants handle stakeholder interview synthesis?"*
> "The synthesis step is where all the margin goes. I've seen consultants spend 2-4 weeks going from interviews to recommendations. The ones who are faster usually have a repeatable framework — they define their analysis lenses before the interviews, not after. That way the synthesis is structured from the start."

### Budget

$0.

### KPIs

| Metric | Month 3 | Month 6 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Karma earned | 500+ | 2,000+ |
| Referral visits/month | 50+ | 200+ |
| Trial signups from Reddit | 5+ | 15+ |

### Timeline

- **Month 1:** Start engaging. No self-promotion.
- **Month 2:** Continue building. Soft mentions when natural.
- **Month 3:** First "I built this" post.

### Kill Criteria

If referral traffic from Reddit is <20 visits/month after 4 months of active engagement, reduce time investment to 1-2 hours/week maintenance mode.

---

## 7. Newsletter Sponsorships

### Why This Channel

Niche newsletters reach exactly your buyer persona in a trusted, high-attention format. Sponsoring a PM or UX newsletter puts UpSight in front of thousands of qualified leads for $200-1,500 per placement.

### Target Newsletters

| Newsletter | Audience | Size | Est. Cost/Placement | Persona |
|-----------|----------|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Lenny's Newsletter** | PMs, founders | 700K+ | $5,000-10,000 | PM, Founder |
| **TLDR** | Tech professionals | 1.2M+ | $2,000-5,000 | Broad |
| **Product School Newsletter** | PMs, product leaders | 100K+ | $1,000-3,000 | PM |
| **UX Collective** | UX practitioners | 500K+ | $500-2,000 | UX |
| **Sidebar** (design) | Designers, UX | 40K+ | $200-500 | UX |
| **The Pragmatic Engineer** | Engineers, tech leads | 600K+ | $3,000-8,000 | Technical |
| **Growth Unhinged** (Kyle Poyar) | PLG practitioners | 50K+ | $1,000-3,000 | Founder, PM |
| **Risky Business** (security) | Cybersecurity | 30K+ | $500-2,000 | Consultant (cyber) |

**Recommended for Phase 1 budget ($500-1,000/month):**
- Start with 1-2 placements in mid-tier newsletters ($200-1,000 range)
- UX Collective, Sidebar, or Growth Unhinged offer the best price-to-relevance ratio
- Save Lenny's for Phase 2 when you have social proof and conversion data

### Sample Sponsor Copy

*For a PM newsletter:*
> **UpSight — Customer evidence that doesn't die in a slide deck**
> You run the interviews. You take the notes. But when leadership asks "how do we know?" — can you point to proof? UpSight turns customer conversations into a searchable evidence library. Every insight is traceable to a real voice.
> → Try free at getupsight.com

*For a UX newsletter:*
> **UpSight — Research synthesis in hours, not weeks**
> Stop manually coding transcripts. UpSight uses AI to extract themes, quotes, and patterns from interviews — while keeping every insight connected to its source. Built for researchers who need evidence, not just summaries.
> → See how it works at getupsight.com

### Budget

| Phase | Monthly Spend | Placements |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Month 2-3) | $500-1,000 | 1-2 mid-tier newsletters |
| Phase 2 (Month 4-6) | $500-1,000 | Scale winners, test higher-tier |

### KPIs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Click-through rate | 1-3% |
| CPL (to trial) | <$100 |
| Cost per demo | <$250 |

### Kill Criteria

- If CPL > $200 after 3 placements in a newsletter, stop that newsletter
- If overall newsletter CPL > $150 after $2K spent, pause and redirect budget to better channels

---

## 8. Google Search Ads

### Why This Channel

Google captures high-intent traffic — people actively searching for "customer research tool" or "Dovetail alternative" are already looking to buy. Even a small budget captures bottom-of-funnel demand that organic SEO hasn't reached yet.

### Target Keywords

**Tier 1 — Highest Intent (start here):**

| Keyword | Est. CPC | Competition | Monthly Volume |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|

| Dovetail alternative | $8-15 | Medium | 200-500 |
| customer discovery platform | $6-12 | Medium | 100-200 |
| stakeholder interview tool | $5-10 | Low | 50-100 |
| qualitative research software | $10-18 | High | 300-600 |

| continuous discovery tool | $5-10 | Low |
| customer feedback analysis tool | $8-15 | Medium-High |
| Looppanel alternative | $3-8 | Low |

**Negative keywords:** academic research, market research survey, CRM, call center, customer service

### Budget & Expected Costs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Monthly budget | $500-1,000 |
| Average CPC | $8-12 |
| CTR | 3-6% |
| Clicks/month | 40-125 |
| CPL (to trial) | $50-150 |
| Trials/month | 5-15 |

### A/B Testing

| Month | Test |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Keyword test: branded vs. category vs. competitor terms |
| 2 | Landing page test: generic vs. persona-specific |
| 3 | Bid strategy: manual CPC vs. maximize conversions |

### Timeline

- **Month 1:** Optional start with $500 on 10 highest-intent keywords
- **Month 2:** Full launch, add Tier 2 keywords
- **Month 3+:** Optimize based on conversion data, scale winners

### Kill Criteria

- Pause keywords with CPC > $20 and no conversions after 50 clicks
- Pause the channel if overall CPL > $200 after $2K total spend
- Scale if any keyword group hits CPL < $80

---

## 9. X / Twitter Organic

### Why This Channel

X is where founders and indie hackers share their journey. The #BuildInPublic community is active and supportive. It's a credibility builder, not a primary acquisition channel.

### Target Audience

- Startup founders (especially indie/bootstrapped)
- PMs who follow thought leaders (Lenny, Teresa Torres, Shreyas Doshi)
- Build-in-public community

### Tactics

**Cadence:** 1-2 tweets/day, 1 thread/week

**Content types:**
- Build-in-public updates: weekly metrics, challenges, wins
- Threads on customer research frameworks
- Quote tweets and replies to PM/founder influencers
- Short video demos or GIFs of UpSight in action

**Sample posts:**

*Build-in-public:*
> Week 4 of UpSight:
> - 30 signups
> - 5 paying customers
> - Top feature request: Zoom import
>
> The thing nobody tells you about building a research tool: your users are better at research than you are.
>
> They find the gaps you missed. And they tell you. In detail.

*Framework thread:*
> Why your customer research dies in slide decks (a thread):
>
> 1/ You do the interviews. You take the notes. You even tag the themes.
>
> 2/ Then someone asks: "But who actually said that?" And you spend 45 minutes digging through recordings to find the quote.
>
> 3/ The problem isn't the research. It's that insights lose their evidence the moment they leave the interview.
>
> [... 5-7 tweets ...]
>
> If this resonated, we're building UpSight to solve exactly this. Voice-first customer evidence that stays connected to its source. → getupsight.com

### Budget

$0.

### KPIs

| Metric | Month 3 | Month 6 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Followers | 300+ | 1,000+ |
| Impressions/week | 5K+ | 20K+ |
| Referral visits/month | 30+ | 100+ |

### Kill Criteria

If impressions are flat (<1K/week) after 8 weeks of consistent posting, reduce investment to 30 min/day and redirect time to LinkedIn.

---

## 10. Email Nurture

### Why This Channel

Email converts better than any social channel. Once someone signs up, email is how you activate them, retain them, and convert them. This is infrastructure, not optional.

### Target Audience

All signups, segmented by:
- **Source** (organic, PH, paid, outreach)
- **Persona** (consultant, founder, PM, UX)
- **Stage** (signed up, activated, engaged, paying)

### Sequences (Built on Brevo Free Tier)

**Sequence 1: Welcome + Activation (Days 0-7)**

| Day | Email | Goal |
|-----|-------|------|
| 0 | Welcome + quick start guide | Set expectations, first action |
| 1 | "Upload your first conversation" | Activation nudge |
| 3 | Value story: how [persona] uses UpSight | Social proof |
| 5 | "See what UpSight found" (if activated) / "Need help getting started?" (if not) | Branched follow-up |
| 7 | "Your first evidence library in 10 minutes" (tutorial) | Deeper engagement |

**Sequence 2: Nurture (Days 8-30)**

| Day 28 | Conversion offer (if on free trial) |

**Sequence 3: Re-engagement (Inactive 14+ days)**

| Email | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Day 14 inactive | "We miss you — here's what's new" |
| Day 21 inactive | "Quick question: what stopped you?" (reply-to survey) |
| Day 30 inactive | Final nudge or sunset |

### Budget

$0 (Brevo free tier covers 300 emails/day, sufficient for early stage).

### KPIs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Welcome email open rate | 60%+ |
| Activation email CTR | 15%+ |
| 7-day activation rate | 40%+ |

## Channel Decision Framework

Use this to decide whether to scale, maintain, or cut a channel:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| CPL < target AND trial → paid > 15% | **Scale** — increase budget 50-100% |
| CPL near target AND trial → paid 10-15% | **Maintain** — keep spend, optimize creative |
| CPL > 1.5x target after $1K+ spend | **Cut** — pause, redirect budget |
| High traffic but zero conversions | **Fix** — landing page or targeting problem |
| Low traffic but high conversion | **Scale** — spend more to increase volume |

Review all channels monthly. No channel gets more than 60 days without a performance review.
