## Executive Summary

This document maps 200+ keywords across four target personas, three intent categories, and three priority tiers. It is designed for a small team that needs to focus effort where it will compound fastest.

**Key findings:**

- **The biggest SEO opportunity is educational content.** Dovetail drives 312K+ monthly visits primarily through informational research-methodology content (e.g., "descriptive research design," "purposive sampling"). UpSight should build topical authority around customer discovery, stakeholder interviews, and evidence-based decisions -- topics Dovetail does not own.
- **Competitor-alternative keywords are low-hanging fruit.** "Dovetail alternative" and related comparison queries have clear commercial intent, moderate volume, and are actively targeted by Looppanel, Condens, and Marvin. UpSight should have comparison pages from day one.
- **Consultant and founder keywords are underserved.** Most competitors target UX researchers. Keywords like "stakeholder interview analysis tool," "customer discovery for consultants," and "product-market fit signals" have low competition because no tool owns these terms yet.
- **Long-tail "how to" queries convert best for small sites.** With a new domain and low domain authority, UpSight should prioritize 4-7 word long-tail queries where a single well-written post can reach page one within 60-90 days.

## Top 20 Priority Keywords (Start Here)

These are the 20 keywords to target first, selected for the intersection of relevance to UpSight's positioning, achievable difficulty, and commercial proximity.

| 20 | consulting discovery process template | 100-200 | Low | Informational | Blog: "Consultant Discovery Playbook" | Consultant |

**Why this order:** Keywords 1-6 are highest priority because they combine low-to-medium difficulty with direct relevance to UpSight's unique positioning (evidence, synthesis, consultants). Keywords 7-10 have higher volume but more competition -- target them with comprehensive content. Keywords 11-20 are supporting content that feeds internal links to the core pages.

## Keyword Research Methodology

### Data Sources & Estimation Approach

Exact search volume data requires paid tools (Ahrefs, Semrush). The estimates in this document are informed by:

1. **Competitive traffic analysis:** Dovetail receives 314K organic monthly visits (Ahrefs estimate). Their non-branded traffic is ~280K, primarily from informational research keywords. Looppanel targets comparison and alternative keywords effectively through blog content.
2. **Category market sizing:** The Voice of Customer software market is $16B+ (2025), with VoC tool queries representing a well-established search category.
3. **SERP analysis:** Competition level is assessed by examining who ranks on page one -- pages from high-DR sites like Dovetail (DR 79), G2, Capterra, and established blogs indicate high competition; pages from smaller sites or forums indicate lower competition.
4. **Relative volume signals:** Google autocomplete, "People Also Ask" prevalence, and related search suggestions indicate relative demand.

### Difficulty Rating Scale

| Rating | What It Means for UpSight (DR < 20) | Typical SERP |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Can rank page 1 within 60-90 days with quality content and 5-10 backlinks | Forums, small blogs, thin content on page 1 |
| **Medium** | Can rank page 1 within 3-6 months with comprehensive content, 15-30 backlinks, and internal linking | Mix of mid-authority sites and some large players |
| **High** | Will require 6-12+ months, strong content, 50+ backlinks, and topical authority to compete | G2, Capterra, Dovetail, major publications dominate |

### Intent Categories

| Intent | Description | Conversion Proximity |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Transactional** | Ready to sign up or buy ("pricing," "free trial," "sign up") | Highest |
| **Commercial** | Comparing options, evaluating tools ("best X tool," "X vs Y," "X alternative") | High |
| **Informational** | Learning, researching a topic ("how to X," "what is X," frameworks) | Lower, but builds authority and captures emails |

### Persona 4: UX Researcher

UX researchers represent the most competitive keyword landscape (Dovetail's primary audience). UpSight should target the "UX researcher without a team" and "research for non-researchers" angles rather than competing head-on for core UXR terms.

## Competitor Keyword Gap Analysis

### What Competitors Rank For That UpSight Should Target

#### Dovetail's Keyword Strategy (314K monthly organic visits)

Dovetail's traffic is dominated by informational research-methodology content that is tangentially related to their product. Their top pages include:

| Dovetail Page Topic | Est. Monthly Traffic | UpSight Opportunity |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Job interview weaknesses | 42K+ | **Skip** -- irrelevant to UpSight |
| Descriptive research design | 10K+ | **Skip** -- academic, low conversion |
| Purposive sampling | 8K+ | **Skip** -- academic, low conversion |
| Margin of error | 8K+ | **Skip** -- academic, low conversion |
| How to synthesize research data | 2K-5K | **Target** -- directly relevant |
| Customer insight tools | 2K-5K | **Target** -- commercial intent |
| User research methods | 2K-5K | **Target** -- educational authority |
| Voice of customer | 1K-3K | **Target** -- core category |
| Research repository | 1K-3K | **Target** -- comparison opportunity |
| Qualitative data analysis | 1K-3K | **Target** -- tools comparison |

**Key insight:** Dovetail drives most of its organic traffic from academic/general research keywords (sampling methods, research design types) that have minimal commercial value. Their commercially relevant pages represent a small fraction of total traffic. UpSight should NOT copy this strategy. Instead, focus on keywords that are closer to buying intent and directly related to the product use case.

#### Looppanel's Content Strategy

Looppanel has effectively captured competitor-comparison traffic through blog content:

| Looppanel Target Keywords | UpSight Action |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Dovetail alternatives | Create `/alternative-to-dovetail` -- our angle is "for teams without dedicated researchers" |
| Dovetail review / Dovetail AI review | Write an honest, balanced review |
| Marvin alternatives | Create comparison content |
| User research analysis tools | Listicle blog post including UpSight |
| Product discovery tools | Listicle blog post with evidence-based angle |
| Best UX research tools | Comprehensive comparison post |

#### Keywords NO Competitor Owns (UpSight's Whitespace)

These keywords represent genuine gaps where no competitor has dedicated content:

| Keyword Gap | Why It's Open | UpSight Content to Create |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| customer discovery for consultants | Competitors target UX researchers, not consultants | Consultant playbook + landing page |
| stakeholder interview analysis tool | No SaaS tool targets this explicitly | Landing page + blog content |
| customer evidence platform | Emerging category -- only UserEvidence (B2B marketing) uses this term | Category-defining landing page |
| evidence-based product decisions tool | PMs search for this; no tool claims it | Blog: frameworks + landing |
| AI-powered research synthesis | Generic AI tools exist but none position for synthesis specifically | Blog: AI synthesis guide |
| consulting discovery process | Consulting content focuses on process, not tools | Blog: Process + tool integration |
| Gong for product teams | Gong targets sales; nobody claims the PM equivalent | Landing: `/gong-for-product-teams` |
| customer intelligence for small teams | Dovetail = enterprise, Gong = sales orgs | Landing page |
| fractional executive customer research | Growing persona, no tool targets them | Blog: Fractional exec guide |
| turn customer conversations into requirements | Obvious pain, no dedicated tool page | Blog: Requirements from conversations |
