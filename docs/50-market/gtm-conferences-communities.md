## Section 1: Conferences & Events

### Evaluation Criteria

Each event is evaluated on:
- **Audience alignment** with UpSight's target personas (consultants, founders, PMs, UX researchers)
- **Cost efficiency** (registration + travel + hotel for a solo founder from San Diego)
- **Speaking opportunity potential** (CFPs open, breakout sessions, lightning talks)
- **Networking value** (1-5 scale: 1 = large/impersonal, 5 = intimate/high-quality connections)
- **Priority level:** Must-Attend, Should-Attend, Nice-to-Have

---

### Must-Attend Events (3-5 events)

These events have the highest ROI for a bootstrapped, pre-PMF founder based in Southern California. They hit UpSight's core personas, have manageable costs, and offer real networking or speaking access.

**Total estimated budget for Must-Attend (attending all 5):** $1,400-4,300

> **Recommendation:** Attend TechCon SoCal, BSides SD, and Advancing Research (virtual) as the non-negotiable three. These cost under $800 combined and hit consultants, cybersecurity contacts, and UX researchers. Add Startup Grind if budget allows for a founder-heavy audience.

## Section 5: Sponsorship Opportunities

### When to Sponsor (Decision Framework)

Sponsorship makes sense for UpSight when:
1. **Cost per lead is competitive** with other channels (target: < $150 CPL)
2. **Audience is a direct match** for at least one target persona
3. **Brand placement drives credibility** in a new category ("customer intelligence")
4. **You've already attended** the event/consumed the content and know the audience quality

Do NOT sponsor if:
- You haven't validated the audience through organic engagement first
- The cost exceeds one month of paid channel budget
- The sponsorship is purely logo placement with no engagement opportunity

### Event Sponsorships

| Event | Sponsorship Cost (Est.) | What You Get | Audience | Cost Per Attendee Reached | Recommendation |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **TechCon SoCal 2026** | $2,000-5,000 (Bronze-Silver) | Exhibit space, logo placement, startup showcase | 1,000+ | $2-5 | **Recommended** -- Local event, great ROI. High visibility at home turf. |
| **Quirk's Event** (any city) | $2,500-14,150 (Bronze-Gold) | Bronze: exhibit space, attendee contacts. Gold: 2 speaking sessions + exhibit + full contact list | 1,600-2,500 | $1.50-8.50 | **Consider Bronze** ($2,500 est.) for exhibit space. Gold ($14K) is too expensive pre-PMF. |
| **Advancing Research** | $2,000-5,000 (est.) | Exhibition, researcher audience, logo on materials | 500-1,000 | $2-10 | **Consider** if virtual attendance generates UXR leads. |
| **BSides San Diego** | $500-2,000 (est., nonprofit pricing) | Community sponsorship, logo, possible booth | 300-500 | $1-6 | **Recommended** -- Cheap, local, builds cybersecurity community goodwill. Tax-deductible (501c3). |
| **StartupSD events** | $500-2,000 (est.) | Event sponsor, speaking slot, logo placement | 200-500 per event | $1-10 | **Recommended** -- Local community investment. Builds long-term San Diego network. |
| **Product-Led Summit** | $3,000-10,000 (est.) | Partner booth, logo, attendee access | 500-1,000 | $3-20 | **Wait** until after attending as participant. |
| **UXPA International** | $3,000-8,000 (est.) | Exhibit space, logo, attendee list | 800-1,200 | $2.50-10 | **Wait** -- expensive for pre-PMF stage. |

### Newsletter Sponsorships

| Newsletter | Audience | Size | Est. Cost Per Issue | CPL Est. | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Lenny's Newsletter** | Senior PMs, product leaders | 700K+ subscribers | $5,000-15,000 (est.) | $100-300 | **Wait** -- too expensive pre-PMF. Pitch a guest article instead. |
| **TLDR Product** | PMs, developers, tech leaders | 100K+ subscribers | $1,000-3,000 (est.) | $50-150 | **Test in Month 2-3** -- one placement to measure CPL. |
| **The Pragmatic Engineer** | Engineers, technical PMs | 500K+ subscribers | $3,000-10,000 (est.) | $100-200 | **Wait** -- more engineering than PM focused. |
| **ProductHQ Newsletter** | PMs at all levels | 50K+ | $500-1,500 (est.) | $50-150 | **Test in Month 2** -- affordable, right audience. |
| **Sidebar (sidebar.io)** | UX designers, researchers | 50K+ | $500-1,500 (est.) | $50-200 | **Test in Month 2** -- good for UX researcher persona. |
| **Dense Discovery** | Designers, product people | 40K+ | $300-800 (est.) | $50-150 | **Test** -- indie/design audience with crossover to UpSight personas. |
| **Hacker Newsletter** | Developers, technical founders | 60K+ | $500-1,500 (est.) | $75-200 | **Consider** -- founder and technical audience. |

> **Newsletter Strategy:** Budget $500-1,000/month for newsletter sponsorship testing starting Month 2. Test 1-2 placements, measure CPL, then scale winners. Target CPL < $150.

### Podcast Sponsorships

| Podcast | Audience | Est. Cost Per Episode | Ad Format | CPL Est. | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Awkward Silences** | UX researchers | $300-800 | Host-read mid-roll | $50-150 | **Test** -- exact persona, affordable |
| **UI Breakfast** | SaaS/UX professionals | $300-800 | Host-read | $50-150 | **Test** -- good SaaS/UX overlap |
| **The SaaS Podcast** | SaaS founders | $500-1,500 | Host-read mid-roll | $50-200 | **Consider** -- after appearing as guest first |
| **Lenny's Podcast** | PMs, product leaders | $5,000-15,000+ | Host-read | $100-300 | **Wait** -- too expensive pre-PMF |
| **Startups For the Rest of Us** | Bootstrapped founders | $500-1,500 | Host-read | $50-200 | **Consider** -- right audience (bootstrapped, SaaS) |

**Podcast Sponsorship Rates Reference:**
- Pre-roll ads: $15-30 CPM
- Mid-roll host-read: $25-40 CPM (general); $50-80+ CPM (B2B niche)
- Post-roll: $10-20 CPM
- B2B SaaS niche premium: 2-3x general rates
- Flat-rate sponsorship for niche shows (500-1,000 downloads): $150-600/episode

> **Podcast Sponsorship Strategy:** Guest on a podcast first, then sponsor if the audience converts. Start with 1-2 niche podcasts ($300-800/episode) in Month 3. Measure with unique landing page URLs or promo codes.

### Sponsorship ROI Framework

Use this framework to evaluate any sponsorship opportunity:

```
Sponsorship ROI Score = (Audience Size x Persona Match %) / Total Cost x 1000

Where:
- Audience Size = total reach (attendees, subscribers, listeners)
- Persona Match % = estimated % who match UpSight's target personas
- Total Cost = sponsorship fee + any production/travel costs

Scoring:
- Score > 50: Strong ROI -- pursue
- Score 20-50: Moderate ROI -- test with small commitment
- Score < 20: Weak ROI -- skip or wait
```

**Example Calculations:**

| Opportunity | Audience | Persona Match | Cost | ROI Score | Verdict |
|------------|----------|---------------|------|-----------|---------|
| TechCon SoCal (Bronze) | 1,000 | 40% | $3,000 | 133 | Strong -- pursue |
| BSides SD | 400 | 30% | $1,000 | 120 | Strong -- pursue |
| Quirk's Dallas (Bronze) | 1,600 | 60% | $2,500 | 384 | Strong -- pursue |
| Lenny's Newsletter | 700,000 | 15% | $10,000 | 10,500 | Misleading -- high score but $10K is too much pre-PMF |
| UXPA International | 1,000 | 70% | $5,000 | 140 | Moderate -- wait until budget grows |

> **Note:** For high-cost sponsorships (> $2,000), also factor in the "learning value" -- will you get direct conversations with prospects, or just logo placement? Direct engagement > brand impressions at the pre-PMF stage.

### Sponsorship Budget Recommendation

| Phase | Monthly Sponsorship Budget | Focus |
|-------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Months 1-2** | $0 | Attend events and engage in communities organically first |
| **Months 3-4** | $500-1,500 | 1-2 newsletter placements + 1 local event sponsorship |
| **Months 5-6** | $1,000-2,500 | Scale winning newsletters + 1 podcast sponsorship + 1 conference |
| **Months 7-12** | $1,500-3,000 | Consistent newsletter cadence + conference exhibits |
| **Year 1 Total** | $6,000-18,000 | |
