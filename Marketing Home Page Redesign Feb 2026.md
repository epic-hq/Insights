``` great improvement. let's refine it.
  i get "Read your customers", but Why "not their data". i don't get it. what's the boom - yes i want that outcome.
  "written right there" feels meh. maybe make it about available across your teams.

  with 3 photos at once zoomed, the annotations get lost.
  These should cycle every  X seconds zoomed in on 1 at a time. each with their key insights easily readable

  might be too long: They’re telling you everything.
  Are you truly hearing them?

  how about:
  They're telling you
  Are you getting it?


  "conviction" is  a powerful word. does that thought belong up in hero somehow?
