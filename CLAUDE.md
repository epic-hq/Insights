# When editing

do not use console.log, use consola.log instead and `import consola from "consola"`
when making database changes, use the supabase declarative schema approach, and edit supabase/schemas/ file instead of creating a migration directly. Follow the process [here](`docs/@supabase/howto/declarative-schemas.md`)

When designing or architecting a new feature, or fixing a bug, consult relevant documents in `docs/` for additional context and best practices relevant to this repo.
