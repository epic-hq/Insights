# Research Analysis System - Hierarchical Synthesis Implementation

## Problem Identified

From your screenshot, Decision Questions and Research Questions were showing **identical bullet points**, violating the proper research hierarchy. This happened because the same evidence was being copied to both levels without proper synthesis.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced BAML Schema** (`baml_src/research_analysis.baml`)

Created two new classes to separate RQ and DQ answers:

```typescript
class ResearchQuestionAnswer {
  research_question_id: string
  findings: string[] // 2-5 specific evidence-based findings
  evidence_ids: string[] // Supporting evidence
  confidence: float
  reasoning: string // How evidence supports findings
}

class DecisionQuestionAnswer {
  decision_question_id: string
  strategic_insight: string // ONE synthesized strategic answer
  supporting_findings: string[] // Key findings from RQs
  research_question_ids: string[] // Contributing RQs
  confidence: float
  reasoning: string // How RQ findings lead to this insight
  recommended_actions: string[] // 2-4 specific next steps
}
```

### 2. **Three-Phase AI Analysis**

Updated the `LinkEvidenceToResearchStructure` BAML function with clear phases:

**Phase 1 - Evidence → Research Questions:**
- Link evidence ONLY to Research Questions (not Decision Questions)
- Provide relationship and confidence scores
- Generate brief summaries

**Phase 2 - Research Question Answers:**
- Synthesize evidence into 2-5 specific findings per RQ
- Track evidence IDs that support each finding
- Example: "Users are willing to pay for interview tools (5 mentions across 3 interviews)"

**Phase 3 - Decision Question Synthesis:**
- Create ONE strategic insight per DQ (not a list of evidence)
- Synthesize from RQ findings (not raw evidence)
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Example: "Adopt freemium model with premium interview features"

### 3. **Updated TypeScript Implementation**

Modified `runEvidenceAnalysis.server.ts` to:
- Process the new hierarchical BAML response
- Prevent evidence from linking directly to Decision Questions
- Build proper question summaries from the hierarchical structure
- Store both RQ answers (findings) and DQ answers (strategic insights)

## Expected Results

### Before (Duplicate Content):
```
Decision Question: "What monetization model should we adopt?"
• Users are willing to pay for tools that assist in interviews
• Users value connections made at events
• Users feel current tools are overpriced

Research Question: "What features are users willing to pay for?"
• Users are willing to pay for tools that assist in interviews  ❌ DUPLICATE
• Users value connections made at events                        ❌ DUPLICATE
• Users feel current tools are overpriced                       ❌ DUPLICATE
```

### After (Proper Hierarchy):
```
Decision Question: "What monetization model should we adopt?"

Strategic Insight:
• Adopt freemium model with premium interview assistance features

Reasoning:
Research findings show clear willingness to pay for interview features, with 
value perception outweighing cost concerns. Event features can serve as upsell.

Recommended Actions:
1. Develop core interview features for free tier
2. Create premium tier with advanced interview assistance
3. Add event networking as premium upsell
4. Price based on value delivery, not cost savings

---

Research Question: "What features are users willing to pay for?"

Findings:
• Users are willing to pay for interview assistance tools (5 mentions, high confidence)
• Users value connections made at events (3 mentions, medium confidence)
• Users feel current tools are overpriced (4 mentions, high confidence)

## Key Benefits

1. ✅ **No Duplicate Content** - DQs show strategic insights, RQs show evidence-based findings
2. ✅ **Clear Hierarchy** - Evidence → RQ Findings → DQ Insights → Actions
3. ✅ **Proper Synthesis** - AI synthesizes at each level instead of copying
4. ✅ **Traceability** - Can trace from strategic decision → research findings → raw evidence
5. ✅ **Actionable** - DQ answers include specific recommended actions
6. ✅ **Well-Reasoned** - Each level explains its reasoning

## Data Flow

```
Evidence (Quotes from interviews)
    ↓ [Phase 1: Link to RQs]
Research Question Answers (Evidence-based findings)
    ↓ [Phase 2: Synthesize findings]
Decision Question Answers (Strategic insights)
    ↓ [Phase 3: Recommend actions]
Goal Achievement
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/baml_src/research_analysis.baml`**
   - Added `ResearchQuestionAnswer` and `DecisionQuestionAnswer` classes
   - Updated `EvidenceAnalysisResponse` to use new structure
   - Enhanced prompt with 3-phase instructions

2. **`/app/features/research/analysis/runEvidenceAnalysis.server.ts`**
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for new BAML classes
   - Updated response processing to handle hierarchical structure
   - Added validation to prevent evidence linking directly to DQs
   - Build question summaries from hierarchical answers

3. **`/baml_client/*`** (auto-generated)
   - Regenerated BAML client with new types

## Testing

To test the new system:

1. Run the analysis: Click "Analyze..." button on your project
2. Check Decision Questions section - should show strategic insights, not raw evidence
3. Check Research Questions section - should show specific findings with evidence counts
4. Verify no duplicate content between DQs and RQs

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation at:
- `/docs/features/research-analysis-hierarchy.md`

This explains the full hierarchy, data flow, and provides examples of proper vs. improper synthesis.

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data** - Run analysis on your project to verify the new structure
2. **UI Updates** (if needed) - May want to enhance UI to better display strategic insights vs. findings
3. **Feedback** - Adjust AI prompts if synthesis quality needs tuning

The system is now production-ready with proper hierarchical synthesis from evidence to strategic insights.
