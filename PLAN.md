# Plan (Single Source)

This file is the single place to track active work. Use simple Kanban buckets and keep entries short. Archive completed or long-form plans in `docs/70-roadmap/`.

## Now
- [ ] (add current top priority)

## Next
- [ ] (add queued work)

## Later
- [ ] (add backlog items)

## Blocked
- [ ] (add blockers with owner + what’s needed)

## Notes
- Mastra v1 migration plan is archived at `docs/70-roadmap/plan-mastra-v1.md`.
- Keep links to specs/docs next to each item to help AI/teammates load context quickly.
