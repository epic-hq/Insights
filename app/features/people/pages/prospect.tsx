	outcome: 5,
	outcomeLabel: "Opportunities",
	stage: "Pay",
	stageDescription: "Already paying for solution",

	validationJourney: [
		{
			phase: "Qualify",
			question: "What do you do in relation to project management?",
			answer:
				"I oversee 5 product teams, each running multiple projects simultaneously. We use a combination of tools but nothing gives us the full picture.",
			evidence: [
				"Manages 5 product teams with 30+ active projects",
				"Current tech stack: Jira, Notion, Slack, Google Sheets",
				"Team size has doubled in past year",
			],
		},
		{
			phase: "Discover",
			question: "Tell me about the last time you struggled with project visibility.",
			answer:
				"Just last week, our CEO asked for a status update on all projects. It took me 6 hours to compile everything from different tools. I had to message 5 different people to get accurate information.",
			evidence: [
				"Spends 6+ hours weekly on status reports",
				"Information scattered across 4+ tools",
				"Frequent context switching causes delays",
				"CEO requests visibility reports 2-3x per month",
			],
		},
		{
			phase: "Behavior",
			question: "What did you try? What do you use today?",
			answer:
				"We tried building custom dashboards in Notion, but they get outdated quickly. Now I have a VA who updates a master spreadsheet daily, but it's still manual and error-prone. We also tried Monday.com but it didn't integrate well with our existing tools.",
			evidence: [
				"Paying VA $2,000/month for manual updates",
				"Tried 3 different solutions in past year",
				"Custom Notion dashboards abandoned after 2 months",
				"Monday.com trial lasted 6 weeks before cancellation",
			],
		},
		{
			phase: "Pain",
			question: "What's annoying or expensive about your current approach?",
			answer:
				"The manual work is killing us. My VA spends 20 hours a week just updating spreadsheets. Plus, by the time we compile reports, the information is already outdated. We've missed critical blockers because they weren't visible in real-time.",
			evidence: [
				"VA costs $2,000/month for manual updates",
				"Reports are 24-48 hours behind reality",
				"Missed 2 critical project blockers last quarter",
				"Team morale affected by constant status update requests",
			],
		},
		{
			phase: "Value",
			question: "What would it mean if this were fixed?",
			answer:
				"If I could see all project statuses in real-time with AI-powered insights, I'd save at least 10 hours a week. More importantly, we'd catch issues before they become problems. I estimate we've lost $50K in the past quarter due to delayed visibility on blockers.",
			evidence: [
				"Would save 10+ hours per week personally",
				"Estimated $50K lost last quarter from delayed issue detection",
				"Could reallocate VA to higher-value work",
				"Would improve team velocity by reducing status meetings",
			],
		},
		{
			phase: "Pay",
			question: "Have you paid / would you pay for a solution?",
			answer:
				"We're currently paying $500/month for our project management stack, but it's not solving the visibility problem. I have budget approval for up to $1,500/month if it actually solves this. We've already allocated budget for Q2 to find a better solution.",
			evidence: [
				"Currently spending $500/month on partial solutions",
				"Budget approved for $1,500/month",
				"Q2 budget allocated for new solution",
				"Willing to pay more for complete solution",
				"Has authority to make purchasing decision",
