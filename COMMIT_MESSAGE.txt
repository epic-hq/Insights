feat: conversation lenses architecture + fix upload_jobs consolidation

## Part 1: Conversation Lenses Migration ✅

Created generic template-based lens system for analyzing interviews through multiple frameworks.

### Database Changes
- Added `conversation_lens_templates` table - stores reusable lens definitions
- Added `conversation_lens_analyses` table - stores analysis results
- Seeded 4 initial templates:
  * Customer Discovery - problem/solution validation
  * User Testing - usability evaluation
  * Sales BANT - opportunity qualification
  * Empathy Map / JTBD - user motivations

### Benefits
- Support multiple analysis frameworks per interview
- Template library approach (easily extensible)
- Evidence-based analysis (faster, cheaper than raw transcript)
- Flexible JSONB structure for any lens type
- Preserves existing sales_lens_* tables (no data loss)

Migration: supabase/migrations/20251202140000_conversation_lenses.sql

## Part 2: Fixed Upload Jobs Consolidation 🔧

Fixed blocking upload error after upload_jobs table was dropped.

### Problem
- Migration 20251202133000 dropped upload_jobs table
- Code still tried to insert/query from it
- Result: "Failed to create upload job: undefined"

### Solution
Consolidated upload tracking into existing `analysis_jobs` table.

### Changes
1. **app/routes/api.onboarding-start.tsx**
   - Removed upload_jobs insert
   - Store upload metadata in analysis_jobs.transcript_data JSONB:
     ```json
     {
       "assemblyai_id": "...",
       "file_name": "...",
       "file_type": "...",
       "external_url": "..."
     }
     ```

2. **app/routes/api.assemblyai-webhook.tsx**
   - Query analysis_jobs by assemblyai_id in JSONB
   - Extract upload metadata from transcript_data
   - Update analysis_jobs status (not upload_jobs)
   - Fixed idempotency checks

3. **app/routes/api.fix-stuck-interview.tsx**
   - Removed upload_jobs fix logic (table doesn't exist)

### Benefits
- Single source of truth (analysis_jobs)
- JSONB flexibility for any metadata
- No new tables/columns needed
- Uploads working again ✅

## Documentation
- CONVERSATION_LENSES.md - Full architecture guide
- LENSES_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md - Implementation phases
- UPLOAD_JOBS_CONSOLIDATION_FIX.md - Detailed fix documentation

## Testing
- ✅ Local migration applied successfully
- ✅ Remote migration pushed
- ✅ Upload flow fixed (no longer references dropped table)
- ⚠️ Integration tests need updating (follow-up task)

## Next Steps
1. Implement BAML functions for lens analysis
2. Build UI components (LensView, LensSelector)
3. Update integration tests to use analysis_jobs
4. Wire lens analysis into interview pipeline
