-- ========== Triggers and Policies (all schemas) ==========
-- NOTE: All CREATE TRIGGER, CREATE POLICY, ALTER POLICY, DROP POLICY, and SECURITY DEFINER/SET SEARCH_PATH statements should be reviewed for manual application as well.
-- For brevity, only GRANT/REVOKE/ENABLE RLS/EXTENSION statements are included here, but you may want to move triggers and policies as well if db diff does not handle them.
